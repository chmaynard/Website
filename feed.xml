&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It now gives me great pleasure to introduce this year’s commencement speaker, Steve Jobs – the Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Apple and Pixar Animation Studios. Stanford University has been characterized since its founding by willingness to be bold and to strike out new directions, and this is a characteristic very much shared by today’s speaker. A pioneer and visionary for almost three decades, his name and the companies he has founded have been synonymous with innovation and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young boy, growing up in Los Altos, Steve Jobs came of age at the same time as Silicon Valley. While still in school, he attended lectures informally at Stanford as well as at Hewlett Packard, where he spent his summer working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating from high school, he left California to attend Reed College. A trek through India, and a short stint as video game designer for Atari followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after his return to the Valley in 1974 he became a regular, along with Steve Wozniak, at meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club, held at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. It was not long before the two of them had built the prototype for the Apple I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple I was very fast at the time, reading and writing four kilobytes in about twenty seconds. About 20,000 times slower than we do so today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple II was faster still, but more importantly introduced color monitors into the home market. In the mid-1980’s the Macintosh became the first truly user friendly personal computer. You didn’t have to be an expert to set it up, or to load software or to transfer information between applications. And the mouse offered point-and-click convenience, and opened the door to computer literacy for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the amazed faces of onlookers, as they saw a computer that was completely different from the personal computers of that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve also co-founded Pixar Animation Studios, which has revolutionized the film industry, in its short history, with a brilliant use of technology, and produced two Academy Award winning films: Toy Story and Finding Nemo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since his return to Apple 8 years ago, Steve has reinvented the company once again, extending its vision to music and new digital media. iPod and iTunes have changed the way we listen to, organize, store and purchase our music. And in my case, the way I often read books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now songs we love are just $0.99, and a completely legal click away. iPhoto and iMovie revolutionized the ability of consumers to organize, edit and display digital photography and video, putting capabilities that once cost thousands of dollars, into the hands of every Mac user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve is also widely recognized for his ability to create an innovative environment inside Apple, as well as an external company image that is equally innovative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think about Apple’s marketing campaigns over the past three decades — a promotional flyer in 1976 showed Isaac Newton sitting under a tree just as an apple was falling by, with the catchy exhortation to byte (B-Y-T-E) into an Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an iconic Super Bowl commercial, telling us that the Macintosh was on the horizon, and assuring us that we would see why 1984 wouldn’t be like 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the late 1990’s we saw banners and billboards, featuring Pablo Picasso, Albert Einstein, Martha Graham, and Mahatma Gandhi all urging us to think different. Steve Jobs understands that creativity and innovation start by thinking differently. He has a deep rooted belief in the power of education to transform lives coupled with a desire to make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the earliest days of Apple, he worked to develop partnerships with educators and get computers into schools. For almost three decades, he and his companies have provided invaluable technology and supports to schools and communities increasing accessibility to information for learners of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 100 years ago in describing his vision for a new university Leland Stanford wrote: “The imagination needs to be cultivated and developed to assure success in life”. Stanford clearly understood that technical knowledge was only the starting point for creation and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs understands that the computer is a very powerful tool in a technical sense, but that its true power lies in the ability to unleash the imagination and creativity of the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained to the New York Times in a 1997 interview, the Macintosh turned out so well, because the people working on it were musicians, artists, poets, and historians, who also happened to be excellent computer scientists. And last fall a Businessweek reporter asked how he manages for innovation — his answer was deceptively simple: “We hire people who want to make the best things in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs personifies the spirit and creativity that have characterized this university since its founding 114 years ago and we are pleased to have him here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join me in warmly welcoming this year’s commencement speaker, Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you. I am honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college. And this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-the-dots&quot;&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We’ve got an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned coke bottles for the $0.05 deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards 10 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;love-and-loss&quot;&gt;Love and loss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down – that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. And don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don’t settle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;death&quot;&gt;Death&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I’m fine now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-remarks&quot;&gt;Final remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960’s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. And I have always wished that for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.&lt;/p&gt;

Though she was a master of the memorable piccolo solo that ends the work, she didn’t take her eyes off the musical score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schaefer was determined to never make a mistake on her notoriously difficult instrument, which sometimes waits silently through portions of concerts, only to suddenly be highlighted for all ears to hear. “I’m either bored to death or scared to death,” she told a Concord newspaper in 1980, “although it’s not as nerve-wracking as it used to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-center&quot;&gt;


    &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/general/lois-schaefer.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;








&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking musician who had been one of only four women in the BSO in the mid-1960s, Ms. Schaefer was 95 when she died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on Jan. 31, 2020 in Sequim, Wash., where she lived in retirement with her older sister, a former cellist with the orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For her 25 years as solo piccolo, Lois Schaefer has been the highest, brightest voice in the Boston Symphony Orchestra,” Globe music critic Richard Dyer wrote in 1990, when she retired from the BSO and the Pops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Schaefer approached playing the piccolo and flute “with great care about technique and correct positions,” said her sister, Winifred Mayes, who in the mid-1950s was the first woman hired for the BSO’s string section. “It somehow suited her personality, which was that way, too. She was meticulous in every way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She played with such quality,” Leone Buyse, a former acting principal flute with the BSO and former principal flutist for the Boston Pops, said of Ms. Schaefer. “She was so consistent,” added Buyse, who is now a flute professor at Rice University’s Shepherd School of Music in Houston. “You could count on Lois to always get the job done. Consistency is a prime requisite in the orchestral field, and she was solid as a rock.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her quarter-century with the Pops and the BSO, Ms. Schaefer drew consistently glowing notices. “To hear her in a Rossini overture is like watching the sunlight dance on rippling water,” Dyer wrote in 1990. “She can also break your heart with a perfectly placed high pianissimo in a Mahler or Shostakovich slow movement.” He added that Ms. Schaefer was “a great artist who has mastered an impossible instrument.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dyer even tipped his hat to her playing on nights when he was less impressed with the rest of the orchestra’s overall performance. Reviewing a 1980 BSO concert at Tanglewood, he likened her performance to “showering diamond dust.” In 1986, Dyer wrote that her piccolo playing was “iridescent” during a Symphony Hall offering of a Ravel selection, conducted by Seiji Ozawa. “Seiji really appreciated her artistry and her collegiality,” Buyse recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Schaefer “was very, very happy in Boston,” her sister said. “She loved the orchestra and the people in it. She always felt very secure and warm towards them, and they towards her. I think it was perfect for her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The younger of two sisters, Lois Elizabeth Schaefer was born in Yakima, Wash., on March 10, 1924. Her father, Charles Frederick Schaefer, was a fruit industry broker. Her mother, Mary Elizabeth Wherry, had been a schoolteacher and taught her daughters piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For me, it was wonderful, I enjoyed it,” Winifred recalled. “For Lois, it was the other side of the coin. Lois did not enjoy piano lessons, and in fact rebelled against them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In elementary school, Ms. Schaefer was offered a choice of other instruments. “I said the trumpet,” she recalled in a 1990 Globe interview. “When my mother heard that, she said, ‘You will not,’ and suggested the clarinet. But when I tried the clarinet, all I could do was squawk, so that’s when I took up the flute.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the dearth of flute teachers in Yakima in that era, as a youth Ms. Schaefer was “mostly self-taught, which is unbelievable,” her sister said. Ms. Schaefer saved money from playing in a trio in the Yakima area to spend a summer at the Interlochen music camp in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was first out of 27 flutists there,” she recalled in the 1980 interview with the Concord publication. “I guess that was the signal that I might make a career in music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting her sights on Boston, she studied at New England Conservatory with Georges Laurent, a former principal flutist with the BSO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She initially played piccolo professionally with the orchestra for a musical at the Shubert Theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In those days you didn’t study the piccolo; it was sort of incidental, and you picked it up while you were learning the flute,” she said in 1990. “So there were a lot of things I had to figure out in a hurry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the piccolo and flute share fingerings, everything else is “diabolically opposed,” she said, adding that she would initially practice piccolo pieces on the flute to solve fingering challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That may be why I have the sound I do, because the sound of the flute is in my ear, and that is what I bring to the piccolo,” she said. “I practice on the piccolo as the final step before the performance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating from New England Conservatory, she performed with the Chicago Symphony and the New York City Opera, filling in at one point for a major BSO foreign tour at the outset of the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1965, she was hired by the BSO, where she stayed until retiring as principal piccolo in 1990, also having been principal piccolo for the Pops. In addition, she was a board member of the National Flute Association, which honored her in 1993 with a Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Schafer formerly lived in Jamaica Plain for many years with her cat, Vivaldi. She gardened there and at her summer place in the Berkshires for the Tanglewood part of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She had beautiful gardens,” said her nephew Nick Winograd of Spring Mills, Pa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the few weeks between the summer and fall concert seasons, Ms. Schaefer and her sister met in Washington State to camp and hike, often around Mount Rainier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was such a bonding thing,” said Winifred, who is 100 and Ms. Schaefer’s only immediate survivor. “We never, never got over that beautiful period of our vacations together.

Our bodies weren’t designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or to get so little exercise. There may be a similar problem with the way we work: a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to suspect this after spending several years working with startup founders. I’ve now worked with over 200 of them, and I’ve noticed a definite difference between programmers working on their own startups and those working for large organizations. I wouldn’t say founders seem happier, necessarily; starting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put it is to say that they’re happier in the sense that your body is happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating doughnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though they’re statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be working in a way that’s more natural for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that I’d only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they seemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times more alive. They’re like different animals. I suspect that working for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion. Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn’t the life they were designed for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trees&quot;&gt;Trees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s so unnatural about working for a big company? The root of the problem is that humans weren’t meant to work in such large groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that each species thrives in groups of a certain size. A herd of impalas might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10. Humans also seem designed to work in groups, and what I’ve read about hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8 work well; by 20 they’re getting hard to manage; and a group of 50 is really unwieldy. [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in groups of several hundred. And yet—for reasons having more to do with technology than human nature—a great many people work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies know groups that large wouldn’t work, so they divide themselves into units small enough to work together. But to coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure. Your boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree. But when you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones, something strange happens that I’ve never heard anyone mention explicitly. In the group one level up from yours, your boss represents your entire group. A group of 10 managers is not merely a group of 10 people working together in the usual way. It’s really a group of groups. Which means for a group of 10 managers to work together as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group working for each manager would have to work as if they were a single person—the workers and manager would each share only one person’s worth of freedom between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were one person. But in a large organization divided into groups in this way, the pressure is always in that direction. Each group tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals that humans were designed to work in. That was the point of creating it. And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree. [2]
Anyone who’s worked for a large organization has felt this. You can feel the difference between working for a company with 100 employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;corn-syrup&quot;&gt;Corn Syrup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake tribe. The number of people you interact with is about right. But something is missing: individual initiative. Tribes of hunter-gatherers have much more freedom. The leaders have a little more power than other members of the tribe, but they don’t generally tell them what to do and when the way a boss can.
It’s not your boss’s fault. The real problem is that in the group above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person. Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels both right and wrong at the same time. On the surface it feels like the kind of group you’re meant to work in, but something major is missing. A job at a big company is like high fructose corn syrup: it has some of the qualities of things you’re meant to like, but is disastrously lacking in others. Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what’s wrong with the usual sort of job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do, at least for programmers. How bad could it be? Well, food shows that pretty clearly. If you were dropped at a random point in America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you. Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil. And yet if you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you’d probably find these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories. “Normal” food is terribly bad for you. The only people who eat what humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing weirdos in Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “normal” food is so bad for us, why is it so common? There are two main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal. You may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first couple bites feels great. The other is economies of scale. Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn’t. Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it’s worth spending a lot to market it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people have to choose between something that’s cheap, heavily marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that’s expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you think most will choose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same with work. The average MIT graduate wants to work at Google or Microsoft, because it’s a recognized brand, it’s safe, and they’ll get paid a good salary right away. It’s the job equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch. The drawbacks will only become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of malaise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like the Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley: though a tiny minority of the population, they’re the ones living as humans are meant to. In an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;programmers&quot;&gt;Programmers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new things. Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support people answer much the same questions; but once you’ve written a piece of code you don’t need to write it again. So a programmer working as programmers are meant to is always making new things. And when you’re part of an organization whose structure gives each person freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you’re going to face resistance when you do something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness. It’s true even in the smartest companies. I was talking recently to a founder who considered starting a startup right out of college, but went to work for Google instead because he thought he’d learn more there. He didn’t learn as much as he expected. Programmers learn by doing, and most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn’t—sometimes because the company wouldn’t let him, but often because the company’s code wouldn’t let him. Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a fraction of the things he would have liked to. He said he has learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has to do all the company’s errands as well as programming, because at least when he’s programming he can do whatever he wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you’re not allowed to implement new ideas, you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do. So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for yourself doesn’t have to mean starting a startup, of course. But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing the startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size of company you work for. If you start the company, you’ll have the most freedom. If you become one of the first 10 employees you’ll have almost as much freedom as the founders. Even a company with 100 people will feel different from one with 1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for a small company doesn’t ensure freedom. The tree structure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom, not a lower bound. The head of a small company may still choose to be a tyrant. The point is that a large organization is compelled by its structure to be one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consequences&quot;&gt;Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has real consequences for both organizations and individuals. One is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger, no matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo. It’s a consequence of the tree structure that every large organization is forced to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if they avoided tree structure. And since human nature limits the size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work together the way components of a market economy do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might be worth exploring. I suspect there are already some highly partitionable businesses that lean this way. But I don’t know any technology companies that have done it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves as sponges: they can stay small. If I’m right, then it really pays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage. Particularly a technology company. Which means it’s doubly important to hire the best people. Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get less done, but they also make you big, because you need more of them to solve a given problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small. It will always suck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization, the more it will suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an essay I wrote a couple years ago I advised graduating seniors to work for a couple years for another company before starting their own. I’d modify that now. Work for another company if you want to, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own startup, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately was that I felt most would fail. And they will. But ambitious programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than going to work at a big company. Certainly they’ll learn more. They might even be better off financially. A lot of people in their early twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even faster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school. At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be zero rather than negative. [3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now funded so many different types of founders that we have enough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from working for a big company. The people who’ve worked for a few years do seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only because they’re that much older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of conservative. It’s hard to say how much is because big companies made them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that made them work for the big companies in the first place. But certainly a large part of it is learned. I know because I’ve seen it burn off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that convinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small group, is the natural way for programmers to live. Founders arriving at Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees. Three months later they’re transformed: they have so much more confidence that they seem as if they’ve grown several inches taller. [4] Strange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the same time. Which is exactly how I’d describe the way lions seem in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear that the difference between the two is due mostly to environment—and in particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to programmers. In the first couple weeks of working on their own startup they seem to come to life, because finally they’re working the way people are meant to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;◼︎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] When I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a certain way, I mean by evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] It’s not only the leaves who suffer. The constraint propagates up as well as down. So managers are constrained too; instead of just doing things, they have to act through subordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3] Do not finance your startup with credit cards. Financing a startup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt stupidest of all. Credit card debt is a bad idea, period. It is a trap set by evil companies for the desperate and the foolish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4] The founders we fund used to be younger (initially we encouraged undergrads to apply), and the first couple times I saw this I used to wonder if they were actually getting physically taller.&lt;/p&gt;

Why not? The answer is simple: our audience doesn’t want to hear from us on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, as individuals they probably have Facebook profiles and may even be part of the demographic that spends up to an hour a day engaging there. However, experience tell us that most are there to stay in touch with their family and friends, laugh at pictures of cats flushing the toilet, or playing Words with Friends. It’s a diversion or “down time” vs. “business time” and that’s not a conducive environment to building a professional relationship between our business and our audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Memory Music&lt;/strong&gt; receives more customer inquiries from the engagement generated on our website and our radio ads than we would ever generate on a social networking site where the latest celebrity gossip is going viral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not suggesting that all businesses abandon Facebook and other social networks. Local businesses, where owners and staff can also have personal relationships with prospects, customers, and advocates, could do very well at generating leads and improving customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is don’t follow the advice of every “social media rock star” and social marketing software salesperson who claims they can improve your business through Facebook engagement. Think independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media marketing success won’t come from just advertising on Facebook, which is really what Facebook for business is. It’s about developing an ongoing relationship with my audience that will start with interested music lovers who turn into customers and customers who turn into advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that relationship is centralized on a social network where you’re paying to engage a small segment of your potential audience while competing with the latest YouTube video, how successful can you be? The customer relationship promised by social media marketing must be owned and centralized on your own digital properties.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Turkle is a clinical psychologist on the faculty at MIT. She has been doing research on the effects of computing technology on our mental health, and in particular on our capacity for empathy and solitude. To introduce you to her ideas, here’s my adaptation of an  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-3-questions-for-sherry-turkle-mit-psychologist-20181020-story.html&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; published last year in the Hartford Courant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interview with Dr. Sherry Turkle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-we-love-our-devices-so-much&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do we love our devices so much?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On a deep level, they offer us the illusion of companionship without the demands of intimacy or challenges to empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Second, they mean that we never have to be bored. Boredom is something that is so important to our psychology and development. The signal achievement of childhood is the capacity to be bored and to transform that into solitude and creativity and looking within the self.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Boredom is also one of the most painful experiences. Devices make us not have to face it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Solitude is something we don’t talk about enough. If you don’t have the capacity for solitude — and I think this is the most important finding in my work — you really can’t form relationships. As a great psychologist said, if you don’t teach your children to be alone, they’ll only know how to be lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What that means is, if you’re always looking to somebody for validation, you’ll always need other people. You’ll always feel lonely if you always need validation. People don’t like to be around those kinds of people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And the third thing is that our phones make us feel less vulnerable. I say to students, “Come to office hours. I’m here. Come! People pay to talk to me!” They’d rather send a text. They don’t want to feel vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With a phone, we can massage our message and make it seem perfect, present ourselves to other people the way we want to be seen by other people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If I really have to talk to somebody, things come out. It comes out if I’m depressed. You can hear it. And people may say, “What’s the matter?” And maybe I don’t want to tell you what’s the matter. Maybe I would feel I’d have to lie, because it’s too intimate to tell you what’s the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes people fear the other person isn’t interested. And you know what? Sometimes the other person isn’t interested. You have to confront that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The point is, you have to confront your own vulnerability. And that’s not a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot about being in life that’s difficult and challenging. If you’re on the screen, you get to avoid all that. Going to a device just feels like the happier choice. But we pay a price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-our-devices-make-us-lonely&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do our devices make us lonely?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons why we’re lonely. So many of our social mores and institutions that used to bring us together don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I grew up, I lived in a neighborhood that had social clubs. It’s never delightful to glamorize one’s youth. My neighborhood was poor. But people felt part of the neighborhood. This was in Rockaway Beach, Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No vegetable ever occurred in that neighborhood. It was not on the radar. But people felt truly part of the neighborhood. There were clubs, there were organizations, the Democratic Party held a dance, other parties held dances too. The Catholic Church had block parties and events.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There was no loneliness because you sat on your porch if you were elderly, and you talked with all the other elderly people sitting on their porches. All the porches faced the courtyard. So you dragged your chair there in the summer to get some sun, and you all sat talking to each other and watching the babies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You didn’t need to bring pet robots to these people, the way my colleagues are trying to bring pet robots to elderly people. They played with babies all day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They weren’t a bit lonely. They lived in a meaningful neighborhood. People organized the way they lived — and the way buildings were built — around the idea that people wanted to hang out with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I now live in two high rises. Honestly, I don’t know who lives to the left and right of me. I make it a point to know who I work with at MIT, but everybody knows that you have to struggle to create any kind of community now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To take my bony finger and say it’s all the fault of cellphones and Facebook would be very naïve. However, it is not the case that Facebook is helping.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you’re a popular high school student and you’re outgoing and swept up in the world, Facebook is not going to do you a lot of harm. It’s not like it’s blocking you from your friends. I’m not making the case that you’re stopping your party life or your club life. But there is a community that is hurting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There’s the 35-year-old nurse I followed for quite a time. She comes home from a shift and a half, she’s single, she’s a lovely woman, and she used to make a point to go out for a light bite, a drink with a friend. She used to get out just to stay in touch with people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now she comes home and gets on Facebook for three hours. Because she’s exhausted and it’s easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-you-seen-as-anti-technology-at-mit&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you seen as anti-technology at MIT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think there’s a split. On the faculty are people who are making robots to do psychotherapy, to read to babies. I think we have to ask, constantly, “Why do we want this?” Why do we want Alexa to pretend she cares? What human value is served? What is pretend empathy going to get me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They say, “It will make you feel good.” What about inauthenticity makes me feel good?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What if living in an authoritarian state makes us feel like we’ve taken Valium? I don’t want to. I want to vote. My highest value is not that the trains are on time. I want to be free.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So on the one hand you have a runaway engineering mentality that I think is dominant because it’s funded. Everybody wants a robot that will do psychotherapy. But If you don’t have empathy, you don’t have psychotherapy. The robot doesn’t know about life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think we’ll be slogging this out for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;








&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we know about Tom Bombadil? He is fat and jolly and smiles all the time. He is friendly and gregarious and always ready to help travellers in distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that none of that can possibly be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider: By his own account (and by Elrond’s surprisingly sketchy knowledge) Bombadil has lived in the Old Forest since before the hobbits came to the Shire. Since before Elrond was born. Since the earliest days of the First Age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet no hobbit has ever heard of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guise in which Bombadil appears to Frodo and his companions is much like a hobbit writ large. He loves food and songs and nonsense rhymes and drink and company. Any hobbit who saw such a person would tell tales of him. Any hobbit who was rescued by Tom would sing songs about him and tell everyone else. Yet Merry – who knows all the history of Buckland and has ventured into the Old Forest many times – has never heard of Tom Bombadil. Frodo and Sam – avid readers of old Bilbo’s lore – have no idea that any such being exists, until he appears to them. All the hobbits of the Shire think of the Old Forest as a place of horror – not as the abode of a jolly fat man who is surprisingly generous with his food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Bombadil has indeed lived in the Old Forest all this time – in a house less than twenty miles from Buckland – then it stands to reason that he has never appeared to a single hobbit traveller before, and has certainly never rescued one from death. In the 1400 years since the Shire was settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we know about Tom Bombadil? He is not what he seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elrond, the greatest lore-master of the Third Age, has never heard of Tom Bombadil. Elrond is only vaguely aware that there was once someone called Iarwain Ben-Adar (“Oldest and Fatherless”) who might be the same as Bombadil. And yet, the main road between Rivendell and the Grey Havens passes not 20 miles from Bombadil’s house, which stands beside the most ancient forest in Middle Earth. Has no elf ever wandered in the Old Forest or encountered Bombadil in all these thousands of years? Apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gandalf seems to know more, but he keeps his knowledge to himself. At the Council of Elrond, when people suggest sending the Ring to Bombadil, Gandalf comes up with a surprisingly varied list of reasons why that should not be done. It is not clear that any of the reasons that he gives are the true one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in his conversation with Frodo, Bombadil implies (but avoids directly stating) that he had heard of their coming from Farmer Maggot and from Gildor’s elves (both of whom Frodo had recently described). But that also makes no sense. Maggot lives west of the Brandywine, remained there when Frodo left, and never even knew that Frodo would be leaving the Shire. And if Elrond knows nothing of Bombadil, how can he be a friend of Gildor’s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we know about Tom Bombadil? He lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question: what is the most dangerous place in Middle Earth? First place goes to the Mines of Moria, home of the Balrog, but what is the second most dangerous place? Tom Bombadil’s country.
By comparison, Mordor is a safe and well-run land, where two lightly-armed hobbits can wander for days without meeting anything more dangerous than themselves. Yet the Old Forest and the Barrow Downs, all part of Tom’s country, are filled with perils that would tax anyone in the Fellowship except perhaps Gandalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is canonical in Tolkein that powerful magical beings imprint their nature on their homes. Lorien under Galadriel is a place of peace and light. Moria, after the Balrog awoke, was a place of terror to which lesser evil creatures were drawn. Likewise, when Sauron lived in Mirkwood, it became blighted with evil and a home to monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there’s Tom Bombadil’s Country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hobbits can sense the hatred within all the trees in the Old Forest. Every tree in that place is a malevolent huorn, hating humankind. Every single tree. And the barrows of the ancient kings that lie nearby are defiled and inhabited by Barrow-Wights. Bombadil has the power to control or banish all these creatures, but he does not do so. Instead, he provides a refuge for them against men and other powers. Evil things – and only evil things – flourish in his domain. “Tom Bombadil is the master” Goldberry says. And his subjects are black huorns and barrow wights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we know about Tom Bombadil? He is not the benevolent figure that he pretends to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom appears to the Ringbearer in a friendly, happy guise, to question and test him and to give him and his companions swords that can kill the servants of another evil power. But his motives are his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider: it is said more than once that the willows are the most powerful and evil trees in the Forest. Yet, the rhyme that Bombadil teaches the hobbits to use in conjuring up Bombadil himself includes the line, “By the reed and willow.” The willows are a part of Bombadil’s power and a means of calling on him. They draw their strength from the cursed river Withywindle, the centre of all the evil in the Forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the springs of the Withywindle are right next to Tom Bombadil’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is Goldberry, “the river-daughter”. She is presented as Bombadil’s wife, an improbably beautiful and regal being who charms and beguiles the hobbits. It is implied that she is a water spirit, and she sits combing her long, blonde hair after the manner of a mermaid. (And it is worth remembering that mermaids were originally seen as monsters, beautiful above the water, slimy and hideous below, luring sailors to drown and be eaten.) But I suggest the name means that in her true state, Goldberry is nourished by the River – that is, by the proverbially evil Withywindle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In folklore and legend (as Tolkien would know well) there are many tales of creatures that can take on human form but whose human shape always contains a clue to their true nature. So what might Goldberry be? She is tall and slender - specifically she is “slender as a willow wand”. She wears a green dress, sits amidst bowls of river water and is surrounded by the curtain of her golden hair. I suggest that she is a Willow tree conjured into human form, a malevolent huorn like the Old Man Willow from whom the hobbits have just escaped. If she is not indeed the same tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-center&quot;&gt;


    &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/general/old-man-willow.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;








&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if this is true, then why does Bombadil save and help the ringbearer and his companions? Because they can bring about the downfall of Sauron, the current Dark Lord of Middle Earth. When Sauron falls, the other rings will fail and the wizards and elves will leave Middle Earth and the only great power that is left will be Bombadil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a boundary around Bombadil’s country that he cannot or will not pass, something that confines him to a narrow space. And in return, no wizard or elf comes into his country to see who rules it, or to disturb the evil creatures that gather under his protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the hobbits return to the Shire after their journey to Mordor, Gandalf leaves them close to Bree and goes towards Bombadil’s country to have words with him. We do not know what they say. But Gandalf was sent to Middle Earth to contend against Sauron and now he must depart. He has been given no mission to confront Bombadil and he must soon leave Middle Earth to powerless men and hobbits, while Bombadil remains, waiting to fulfill his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I think that Tolkien planned things in this way? Not at all, but I find it an interesting speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To speculate further and more wildly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spell that binds Bombadil to his narrow and cursed country was put in place centuries ago by the Valar to protect men and elves. It may last a few decades more, perhaps a few generations of hobbit lives. But when the last elf has gone from the havens and the last spells of rings and wizards unravel, then it will be gone. And Iarwain Ben-Adar, Oldest and Fatherless, who was ruler of the darkness in Middle Earth before Sauron was, before Morgoth set foot there, before the first rising of the sun, will come into his inheritance again. And one dark night the old trees will march westward into the Shire to feed their ancient hatred. And Bombadil will dance down amongst them, clad in his true shape at last, singing his incomprehensible rhymes as the trees mutter their curses and the black and terrible Barrow-Wights dance and gibber around him. And he will be smiling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Keith Martin</name></author><category term="General" /><summary type="html">OLD TOM BOMBADIL.

Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in this sad condition because 200 years ago we invented a toxic form of knowledge called news. The time has come to recognize the detrimental effects that news has on individuals and societies, and to take the necessary steps to shield us from its dangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At core, we are cavemen in suits and dresses. Our brains are optimized for a hunter-gatherer environment where we lived in small bands of 25 to 100 individuals with limited food and information sources. Our brains (and our bodies) now live in a world that is the opposite of what we are designed to handle. This leads to great risk and to inappropriate, outright dangerous behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few decades, the fortunate among us have recognized the hazards of living with an overabundance of food (obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome) and have started to shift our diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News is to the mind what sugar is to the body. News is easy to digest. The media feeds us small bites of trivial matter, tidbits that don’t really concern our lives and don’t require thinking. That’s why we experience almost no satiation. Unlike reading books and long, deep magazine articles (which requires thinking), we can swallow limitless quantities of news flashes, like bright colored candies for the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we have reached the same point in relation to information overload that we faced 20 years ago with food intake. We are beginning to recognize how toxic news can be and we are learning to take the first steps toward an information diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my attempt to clarify the dangers of the most toxic form of information – news – and to provide some recommendations about how to deal with it. I have now gone without news for a year, so I can see, feel and report the effects of this freedom first hand: less disruption, more time, less anxiety, deeper thinking, more insights. It’s not easy, but it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My good friend Nassim Nicholas Taleb was one of the first people to recognize news consumption as a serious problem. I owe most of the following insights to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-misleads-us-systematically&quot;&gt;News misleads us systematically&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News reports do not represent the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brains are wired to pay attention to visible, large, scandalous, sensational, shocking, people-related, story-formatted, fast changing, loud, graphic onslaughts of stimuli. Our brains have limited attention to spend on things that are small, abstract, ambivalent, complex, slow to develop and quiet, much less silent. News organizations systematically exploit this bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news media, by and large, focus on the highly visible. They display whatever information they can convey with gripping stories and lurid pictures, and they systematically ignore the subtle and insidious, even if it is more important. News grabs our attention; that’s how its business model works. Even if the advertising model didn’t exist, we would still soak up news pieces because they are easy to digest and superficially quite tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highly visible misleads us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the following event. A car drives over a bridge, and the bridge collapses. What does the news media focus on? On the car. On the person in the car. Where he came from. Where he planned to go. How he experienced the crash (if he survived). What kind of person he is (was). But – that is all completely irrelevant. What’s relevant? The structural stability of the bridge. That’s the underlying risk that has been lingering for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car doesn’t matter at all. It could have been any car that caused the bridge to collapse. It could have been a strong wind or a dog walking over the bridge. So, why does the media cover the car? Because it’s flashy, it’s dramatic, it’s a person (non-abstract), and it’s news that’s cheap to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of news, we walk around with the completely wrong risk map in our head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrorism is overrated. Chronic stress is underrated.
The collapse of Lehman is overrated. Fiscal irresponsibility is underrated.
Astronauts are overrated. Nurses are underrated.
Britney Spears is overrated. IPCC Reports are underrated.
Airplane crashes are overrated. Resistance to antibiotics is underrated.
We are not rational enough to be exposed to the press. It is a very dangerous thing, because the probabilistic mapping we get from consuming news is entirely different from the actual risks that we are exposed to. If you watch an airplane crash on news television, it’s going to change your attitude toward that risk regardless of its real probability, no matter your intellectual sophistication. If you think you can compensate this bias with the strength of your own inner contemplation, you are wrong. Bankers and economists – who have powerful incentives to compensate for news-borne hazards – have shown that they cannot. The only solution: cut yourself off from news consumption entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-is-irrelevant&quot;&gt;News is irrelevant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months, name one that – because you consumed it – allowed you to make a better decision affecting your life, your career, your business – compared to not having swallowed that piece of news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is: the consumption of news is irrelevant to the forces that really matter in your life. At its best, it is entertaining, but it is still irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume that, against all odds, you found one piece of news that substantially increased the quality of your life – compared to how your life would have unfolded if you hadn’t read or seen it. How much trivia did your brain have to digest to get to that one relevant nugget? And that is a hindsight analysis. Looking forward, we can’t even identify the value of a piece of news before we see it. So we are forced to digest everything on the news buffet line. Is that worth it? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1914, Sarajevo was the news story that dwarfed all other news in terms of its significance that year by a factor of a billion. But, Sarajevo was just one of several thousand stories in circulation on that day. No news organization treated it anything more than just another politically inspired assassination. The first Internet browser debuted in 1995. That hugely relevant piece of software, which bore such important future impact, barely made it into the press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very difficult for us to recognize what’s relevant. It’s much easier to recognize what’s new. We are not equipped with sensory organs for relevance. Relevance doesn’t come naturally. News does. That’s why the media plays on the new. (If our minds were structured the other way round, the media would certainly play on the relevant.) The relevant versus the new is the fundamental battle of the modern man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News creates a worldview that is not relevant to you. What does relevance mean? It means: what is important to you personally. Relevance is a personal choice. Don’t take the media’s view for it. For the media, anything that sells lots of copies is relevant – Darfour, Paris Hilton, a train crash in China, some idiotic world record (someone who ate 78 cheese burgers in one hour).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the news industry has a swindle at the core of its business (this it shares with the circus performances, Freudian psychotherapy and palm-reading). It sells the relevant, but delivers the new. In short, it’s a camouflage industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media organizations want us to believe that news offers some sort of a competitive advantage. Many people fall for that. We get anxious when we’re cut off from the flow of news. We fear we’ve missed something important. In reality, news consumption is a competitive disadvantage. The less news you consume the bigger the advantage you have over others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afraid you will miss “something important”? Believe me, if something really important happens, you will hear about it, even if you try to live protected from the news in a cocoon. Friends and colleagues will tell you the relevant events far more reliably than any news organization. They will do this with the added benefit of meta-information, since you know how they think. If you don’t have friends, you will learn far more about really important events and societal shifts by reading about them in specialized journals, in-depth magazines or good books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-limits-understanding&quot;&gt;News limits understanding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News has no explanatory power. News items are little bubbles popping on the surface of a deeper world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News organizations pride themselves on correctly reporting the facts, but the facts that they prize are just epiphenomena of deeper causes. Both news organizations and news consumers mistake knowing a litany of facts for understanding the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not “news facts” that are important, but the threads that connect them. What we really want is  to understand the underlying processes, how things happen. Unfortunately, precariously few news organizations manage to do this. The problem is that the underlying processes that govern significant social, political and environmental movements mostly are invisible. They are complex, non-linear and hard for our (and the journalists’) brains to digest. Why do news organizations go for the light stuff, the anecdotes, scandals, people-stories and pictures? The answer is simple: because they are cheaper to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important stories are non-stories: slow, powerful movements that develop below the journalists’ radar but have a transforming effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people believe that more information makes for better decisions. News organizations support this belief. Hell, it’s in their own interest. Will the accumulation of facts help you understanding the world? Sadly, no. The relationship is actually inverted. The more “news factoids” you digest, the less of the big picture you will understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that information junkies are better decision makers. They are certainly not more successful than the average Joe. If more information leads to higher economic success we would expect journalists to be on top of the pyramid. That’s not the case. Quite to the contrary. We don’t know what makes people successful, but amassing information is certainly not part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading news to understand the world is worse than not reading anything. What’s best: cut yourself off from daily news consumption entirely. Read books and thoughtful journals instead of gulping headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-is-toxic-to-your-body&quot;&gt;News is toxic to your body&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News constantly triggers the limbic system. They spur the release of cascades of glucocordicoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones. In other words, your body finds itself in a state of chronic stress. The effects of high glucocordicoid levels are impaired digestion, lack of growth (cell, hair, bone), nervousness and susceptibility to infections. News consumers risk impairing their physical health. The other potential effects of news include fear, aggression, tunnel thinking and desensitization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-is-toxic-for-societies&quot;&gt;News is toxic for societies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the tendency to personalize and politicize the news has a polarizing impact on democracy. Media users fall into increasingly targeted, narrowcast streams of information and, therefore, become less likely to encounter input that challenges their partisan views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, humankind is susceptible to fads, hypes and hysterias. News leads to collective neurosis. As a matter of fact, every large-scale collective neurosis has been driven by news. There is no other way to generate one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, stories portraying acts of violence have an inordinately negative impact at many levels. Psychological scars – induced by chronic stress, horrifying images and traumatic memories – do not heal easily. News adds to health costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-massively-increase-cognitive-errors&quot;&gt;News massively increase cognitive errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News feeds the mother of all cognitive errors: confirmation bias. We automatically, systematically filter out evidence that contradicts our preconceptions in favor of confirming evidence. In the words of Warren Buffett: “What the human being is best at doing, is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.” That is the confirmation bias. News consumption, especially the ability to customize our news intake, exacerbates this human flaw. The result is that we walk around in a cloud of seemingly confirming data – even when our theories about ourselves and the world may be wrong. We become prone to overconfidence, take stupid risks and misjudge opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News not only feeds the confirmation bias. There is another cognitive error at play: the story bias. Our brains crave stories that “make sense” – even if they don’t correspond to reality. And news organizations are happy to deliver those fake stories. Instead of just reporting that the stock market declined (or increased) by 2%, they say “the market declined by 2% because of X”. X can be a bank profit forecast, fear about the Euro, non-farm payroll statistics, a Fed decision, a terrorist attack in Madrid, a subway strike in New York, a handshake between two presidents, anything, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of high school. My text book specified seven reasons (not six, not eight) why the French Revolution broke out. Fact is, we don’t know why the French Revolution broke out. And especially not why in 1789. And we don’t know why the stock market moved as it moved. There are just too many factors that go into it. We don’t know why an airplane crashed or why the oil price jumped. We don’t know. Any journalist who writes “the market moved because of X” or “the company went bankrupt because of Y” is an idiot. Of course, X might have had a casual influence, but it’s far from established, and there are most likely influences that are much greater than X. To a large degree, news reports consist of nothing but stories and anecdotes that end up substituting for coherent analyses. I am fed up with this cheap way of “explaining” the world. It’s inappropriate. It’s irrational. It’s forgery. And I don’t let my thinking get contaminated by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-inhibits-thinking&quot;&gt;News inhibits thinking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking requires concentration. Concentration requires uninterrupted time. News items are like free-floating radicals that interfere with clear thinking. News pieces are specifically engineered to interrupt you. They are like viruses that steal attention for their own purposes. This is not about stealing time (see reason 9). This is about the inability to think clearly when you open up yourself to the factoid stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News makes us into shallow thinkers. But it’s worse than that. News severely affects memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;»The passageway from working memory to long-term memory forms a bottleneck in our brain. While the long-term memory has an almost unlimited capacity, working memory can hold only a relatively small amount of information at a time (try repeating a 10-digit phone number if you hear it for the first time). That short-term storage is fragile: A break in our attention can sweep its contents from our mind.« Because news disrupts concentration, it actively weakens comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t visit Paris or speed through the Museum of Modern Art in two minutes. Why not? Because the brain needs spool-up time. Building up concentration takes a minimum of a 10-minute read. At minimum. If it is less, your brain will processes the information superficially and barely store it. News pieces are like wind hitting your cheek. Ask yourself: What are the top twenty news pieces from a month ago (that are no longer in the news today). So, why would you want to consume something that doesn’t stick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse with online news. In a 2001 study[1] two scholars in Canada showed that the comprehension declines as hyperlinks in a document increase. Why? Because whenever a link appears, your brain has to at least make the choice not to click, which itself is distracting. News consumers are suckers for irrelevancy. Online news consumers are the biggest suckers. News is an interruption system. It seizes our attention only to scramble it. Besides a lack of glucose in your blood stream, news distraction is the biggest limitation on clear thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-changes-the-structure-of-your-brain&quot;&gt;News changes the structure of your brain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News works like a drug. It feeds compulsive information-seeking behavior (CISB). The uninterrupted supply makes us crave more. As stories develop, we naturally want to know how they continue. With hundreds of arbitrary story lines in our heads, this craving is increasingly compelling and hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is news addictive? Once you get into the habit of checking the news, you are driven to check it even more often. Your attention is set on fast-breaking events, so you hunger for more data about them. This has to do with a process called long-term potentiation (LTP) and the reward circuits in your brain. Addicts seek more of an addictive substance to get their fix, because they need more stimulation than non-addicts to reach a satisfying reward threshold. If you set your attention on other things – like literature, science, art, history, cooking, pet grooming, whatever – you will become more focused on those things. That’s just how the brain works. It’s a simple cognitive process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People used to think that our brain, the dense connections formed among the 100 billion neurons inside our skulls, was largely fixed by the time we reached adulthood. Today we know that this is not the case. The human brain is highly plastic. Nerve cells routinely break old connections and form new ones. When we adapt to a new cultural phenomenon, including the consumption of news, we end up with a different brain. Adaptation to news occurs at a biological level. News reprograms us. That means our brain works differently even when we’re not consuming news. And that’s dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more news we consume, the more we are exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming and multitasking while ignoring those used for reading and thinking deeply. Most news consumers – even if they used to be avid book readers – have lost the ability to read and absorb longish articles or books. After four, five pages they get tired, their concentration vanishes, they become restless. It’s not because they got older or their time schedules got denser. It’s because the physical structure of their brains has changed. In the words of Professor Michael Merzenich (University of California, San Francisco), a pioneer in the field of neuroplasticity: “We are training our brains to pay attention to the crap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear me: Deep reading is indistinguishable from deep thinking. When you consume news, your brain structurally changes. And this means that the way you think changes. Regaining the capacity for concentration and contemplation will take nothing but a radical news diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains, Wired, May 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-is-costly&quot;&gt;News is costly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News wastes time. It exacts exorbitant costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News taxes productivity three ways. First, count the consumption-time that news demands. That’s the time you actually waste reading or watching the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, tally up the refocusing time – or switching cost. That’s the time you waste trying to get back to what you were doing before the news interrupted you. You have to collect your thoughts. What were you about to do? Every time you disrupt your work to check the news, reorienting yourself could easily waste minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, news distracts us even hours after we’ve digested today’s hot items. News stories and images pop into our minds hours, sometimes days later and will constantly interrupt your train of thought. Why would you want to do that to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the newspaper for 15 minutes each morning, then check the news for 15 minutes during lunch and 15 minutes before you go to bed, you’re eating up substantial time. Then, add five minutes here and there when you’re at work, plus distraction and refocusing-time. You will lose productive hours totaling at least half a day every week. Half a day – and for what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a global level, the loss in potential productivity is huge. Take the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, where terrorists murdered some 200 people in an act of chilling exhibitionism. Imagine that a billion people devoted, on average, one hour of their attention to the Mumbai tragedy: following the news, watching some talking head on TV, thinking about it. The number is a wild guess, but the guess is far from a wild number. There are more than a billion people in India alone. Many there spent whole days following the drama. One billion people times one hour is one billion hours, which is more than 100,000 years. The global average life expectancy is today 66 years. So nearly 2,000 lives were swallowed by news consumption. It’s far more than the number of people murdered, by any standards. In a sense, the newscasters became unwilling bedfellows of the terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is no longer a scarce commodity. But attention is. Why give it away so easily? You are not that irresponsible with your money, your reputation or your health. Why then give away your mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-sunders-the-relationship-between-reputation-and-achievement&quot;&gt;News sunders the relationship between reputation and achievement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual reputation affects how people cooperate in society. In our ancestral past, a person’s reputation was directly linked to his or her achievements. You saw that your fellow tribe member killed a tiger single handedly and you spread word of his bravery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of mass-produced news, the strange concept of “fame” entered our society. Fame is misleading because generally people become famous for reasons that have little relevance to our lives. The media grants fame to movie stars and news anchors for scant reason. News sunders the relationship between reputation and achievement. The tragedy is that their notoriety crowds out the achievements of those who make more substantive contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-is-produced-by-journalists&quot;&gt;News is produced by journalists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some journalists take time with their stories and try to think things through. But like any profession, and probably more so than in any other profession, journalism has its incompetent, unfair practitioners who don’t have the time – or the capacity – for deep analysis. Often, they are paid by the piece, the line, or the word. You might not be able to tell the difference between a polished professional and a rushed, glib, paid-by-the-piece writer with an ax to grind. It all looks like news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer than ten percent of the news stories are original. Fewer than one percent are truly investigative. And only once every fifty years journalists uncover a Watergate. The rest is cobbled together from other news reports, common knowledge and whatever the journalist can find on the internet. Many journalists, in their rushed schedule, blindly copy from each other. The copying and the copying of the copies not only multiplies the flaws in the stories but also the irrelevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reported-facts-are-sometimes-wrong-forecasts-always&quot;&gt;Reported facts are sometimes wrong, forecasts always&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, reported facts are simply mistaken. With reduced editorial budgets at major publications, fact checking may be an endangered step in the news process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker Magazine was legendary for their fact checking. When an article mentioned the Empire State Building, the fact checking department would go out and visually verify that, in fact, the building was still standing. I don’t know if the story is true, but it highlights a point. Today, the fact checker has become an endangered species in most news companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many news stories include predictions, but accurately predicting anything in our complex world is impossible. Overwhelming evidence indicates that forecasts by journalists and by experts in finance, social development, global conflicts and technology are almost always completely wrong. So, why consume that junk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the newspapers predict World War I, the Great Depression, the sexual revolution, the fall of the Soviet empire, the rise of the Internet, resistance to antibiotics, the fall of Europe’s birth rate or the explosion in depression cases? Maybe, you’d find one or two correct predictions in a sea of millions of mistaken ones. Incorrect forecast are not only useless, they are harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the accuracy of your predictions, cut out the news and roll the dice or. If you are ready for depth, read books to understand the invisible generators that affect our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-is-manipulative&quot;&gt;News is manipulative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News is the perfect Trojan horse. Few bits of news arrive without a hidden agenda, and many news stories crop up with big obvious agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our evolutionary past has equipped us with a good bullshit detector for face-to-face interactions. We automatically use many clues to detect manipulation, clues that go beyond the verbal message and include gesture, facial expression, signs of nervousness such as sweaty palms, blushing and body odor. Living in small bands of people, we almost always knew the background of the messenger. Information always came with a rich set of meta data. Today, even conscientious readers find that distinguishing even-handed news stories from ones that have a private agenda is difficult and energy consuming. Why go through that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting is biased. Stories are selected or slanted to please advertisers (advertising bias) or the owners of the media (corporate bias), and here is a tendency to report what everyone else is reporting, and to avoid stories that will offend anyone (mainstream bias).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PR industry is as large as the news reporting industry – the best proof that journalists and news organizations can be manipulated. Corporations, interest groups and other organizations would not expend these huge sums if PR didn’t work. If journalists with their natural skepticism towards powerful organizations can be manipulated, what makes you think you can escape it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Nurse Nayirah story. Nayirah was a fifteen-year-old Kuwaiti girl, who alleged that she had witnessed the murder of infant children by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait, in verbal testimony to the U.S. Congress, in the run up to the 1991 Gulf War. Virtually every media outlet covered the story. The U.S. public was in rage, which in turn pushed the congress closer to approving the war. Her testimony, which was regarded as credible at the time by all the media outlets, has since come to be regarded as wartime propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look back over the 20th century and ask yourself how many atrocities could have been prevented if the majority of people would have followed a simple news diet. It’s a wild thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more: Journalism shapes a common picture of the world and a common set of narratives for discussing it. It sets the public agenda. Hold on: do we really want the newsmakers to influence the public agenda? I believe that agenda setting by the media is just bad democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-makes-us-passive&quot;&gt;News makes us passive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot influence. This sets readers up to have a fatalistic outlook on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this with our ancestral past, where you could act upon practically every bit of news. Our evolutionary past prepared us to act on information, but the daily repetition of news about things we can’t act upon makes us passive. It zaps our energy. It grinds us down until we adopt a worldview that is pessimistic, desensitized, sarcastic and fatalistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the human brain encounters a barrage of ambiguous information without being able to act upon that information, it can lead to passivity and a sense of victimhood. The scientific term is learned helplessness. It’s a bit of a stretch, but I would not be surprised if news consumption at least partially contributes to the widespread disease of depression. Viewed on a timeline, the spread of depression coincides almost perfectly with the growth and maturity of the mass media. It could turn out to be a coincidence, and I am skeptical about this type of conjecture, but I don’t want to leave it unmentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-gives-us-the-illusion-of-caring&quot;&gt;News gives us the illusion of caring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Norris (even if I don’t share most of her ideas) said it best: “We may want to believe that we are still concerned, as our eyes drift from a news anchor announcing the latest atrocity to the NBA scores and stock market quotes streaming across the bottom of the screen. But the ceaseless bombardment of image and verbiage makes us impervious to caring.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News wraps us in a warm global feeling. We are all world citizens. We are all connected. The planet is just one global village. We sing the “We-are-the-World” song and wave the little flame of our lighters in perfect harmony with thousands of others. It’s a glowing and fuzzy feeling that delivers the illusion of care but doesn’t get us anywhere. I haven’t had the time to put my finger on it, but this allure for anything global smells like a gigantic chimera. Like a religion. Fact is, we are not connected because we consume news. We are connected because we trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-kills-creativity&quot;&gt;News kills creativity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things we already know severely impact creativity. This is one reason why mathematicians, novelists, composers or entrepreneurs produce their most creative works at a young age. They are oblivious to much that has been tried before. Their brains enjoy a wide, uninhabited space that allows them to come up with novel ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know a single truly creative mind who is a news junkie – not a writer, not a composer, mathematician, physician, scientist, musician, designer, architect or painter. On the other hand, I know a whole bunch of viciously uncreative minds who consume news like drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creativity-killing effect of news might also be owned to something simpler we’ve discussed before: distraction. I just can’t imagine producing novel ideas with the distraction that news is sure to deliver. If you want to come up with old solutions, read news. If you are looking for new solutions, don’t read news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do-instead&quot;&gt;What to do instead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go without news. Cut it out completely. Go cold turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make news as inaccessible as possible. Delete the news apps from your iPhone. Sell your TV. Cancel your newspaper subscriptions. Do not pick up newspapers and magazines that lie around in airports and train stations. Do not set the browser default to a news site. Pick a site that never changes. The more stale the better. Delete all news sites from your browser’s favorites list. Delete the news widgets from your desktOp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep the illusion of “not missing anything important”, I suggest you glance through the summary page of the Economist once a week. Don’t waste more than five minutes on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read magazines and books which explain the world – Science, Nature, The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly. Go for magazines that connect the dots and don’t shy away from presenting the complexities of life – or from purely entertaining you. The world is complicated, and there is nothing we can do about it. So, you must read longish and deep articles and books that represent its complexity. Try reading a book a week. Better two or three. History is good. Biology. Psychology. That way you’ll learn to understand the underlying mechanisms of the world. Go deep instead of broad. Enjoy material that truly interests you. Have fun reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week will be the hardest. Deciding not to check the news while you are thinking, writing or reading takes discipline. You are fighting your brain’s built-in tendency. Initially, you will feel out of touch or even socially isolated. Every day you will be tempted to check your favorite news Web site. Don’t do it. Stick to the cold-turkey plan. Go 30 days without news. After 30 days, you will have a more relaxed attitude toward the news. You will find that you have more time, more concentration and a better understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, you will realize that despite your personal news blackout, you have not missed – and you’re not going to miss – any important facts. If some bit of information is truly important to your profession, your company, your family or your community, you will hear it in time – from your friends, your mother in law or whoever you talk to or see. When you are with your friends, ask them if anything important is happening in the world. The question is a great conversation starter. Most of the time, the answer will be: “not really.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you afraid that living a news-free existence will make you an outcast at parties? Well, you might not know that Paris Hilton is in jail (I don’t know, I am making this up), but you will have more intelligent facts to share – about the cultural meaning of the food you are eating or the discovery of exosolar planets. Never be shy about your news diet. People will be fascinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society needs journalism – but in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigative journalism is relevant in any society. We need more hard-core journalists digging into meaningful stories. We need reporting that polices our society and uncovers the truth. The best example is Watergate. But important findings don’t have to arrive in the form of news. Often, reporting is not time sensitive. Longish journal articles and books are fine forums for investigative journalism – and now that you’ve gone cold turkey on the news, you’ll have time to read them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rolf Dobelli</name></author><category term="General" /><summary type="html">We are so well informed and yet we know so little.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Gerome Brush (1936)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand_Gillet&quot;&gt;Fernand Gillet&lt;/a&gt; was one of the new members to join the Boston Symphony in 1925. He is at home and at ease anywhere; but there is something about Gillet that leaves you wondering if he really likes being away. His parents were both French and both musical, his father a well-known composer and ‘cellist. Despite his French origin, he has an Anglo-Saxon air which unquestionably comes from having been brought up in an English school. In the [First] World War, he served for four and a half years as an aviator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Gillet is reticent and the meaning of his words is very often oblique. When he was asked what instrument he thought the best, he replied: “A great artist.” His uncle was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Gillet&quot;&gt;Georges Gillet&lt;/a&gt;, the teacher of oboe at the Paris Conservatory. Although young Gillet had started off as a pianist, the opportunity of learning the oboe at the Conservatory presented itself—and his destiny was settled.&lt;/p&gt;

Everything I had ever learned, thought or felt about the piano and performance upon it went up in smoke. Sokolov, although a well-kept secret, is for many the greatest pianist alive today. Youthful celebrities with fast fingers, designer gear, and slick photos pall beside such gigantic artistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;shaded-box&quot;&gt;
Adapted from an article by Jessica Duchen in the British publication 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhinegold.co.uk/rhinegold-publishing/magazines/international-piano/&quot;&gt;International Piano&lt;/a&gt;
, Sep-Oct 2006.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sokolov is a pianistic Dostoyevsky, his music-making vast in scope, visionary and revelatory, squeezing out every last drop of meaning. After much effort on the part of the barbican press officer and Sokolov’s agent, I manage to pin down the great Russian pianist for his first interview with a British journalist in nine years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins with his recital in the Palau de la Musica Catalana in Barcelona. This must be the world’s most colourful concert hall: A modernist masterpiece ebullient with stained glass, statuary and bright-hued architectural detail. Watching Sokolov give a recital here is like seeing a black-and-white movie superimposed on technicolor: A grey-haired man in black and white at an ebony and ivory piano, playing in a way that few pianists have ever played, certainly not since the “golden age” of the early 20th century. The individuality of his musicianship harks back to another era as much as any classic movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the colour in his playing is so vivid that it puts the palau’s visual richness in the shadow at once. We talk backstage after the oncert, aided by a Russian cellist as interpreter. Spain being Spain, the recital had begun at 9pm. Sokolov being Sokolov, the encores were generous while the night draws on. By the time we sit down in the dressing room it is nearly midnight. Sokolov is still in the midst of a post-performance high. “Now it is still after the concert,” he remarks, “but in three or four hours it will be time to prepare for the next concert.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-left&quot;&gt;


    &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/general/grigory-sokolov.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;








&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Sviatoslav Richter, Grigory Sokolov is a musician around whom tremendous mystique has formed. He meets none of the modern expectations of a mega-star; he seems to have stepped out of a different universe, a distant and purer world. If he’s not yet as universally celebrated as he should be, that’s because he doesn’t like publicity, interviews or, indeed, anything extraneous to making music. His mind is phenomenally sharp and informed. He employs no gimmicks and takes no prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put it to him that he makes no concessions to the extra-musical demands of the music business. “That’s not a question, it’s a compliment,” he exclaims. “Yes, I don”t like anything that is not a matter of music. Indeed, I hate it. Anything that disturbs the music is against it and has no place together with it. Naturally, if you like music you don’t like those other things. If you don’t like music, you work in other areas. If you like music, you accept that it’s enough for your whole life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was born in Saint Petersburg and still lives there – theoretically. “Practically, I live in the plane and the car.” He can’t remember when his passion for music began: “I can only explain what I know from my parents. They said that if I heard music in the street, I stopped immediately and wanted to listen to it. At home we had some records, and I had a little podium and baton, and I conducted everything that was there! Then they asked a piano teacher what to do with me; she told them to wait until I was five years old. When I began to study piano, I forgot my dream to be a conductor and wanted only to play. Everything was the opposite way round from the usual. Many pianists begin by playing and later they start conducting. I had already had it with conducting by the age of four.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1966, when he was only sixteen, he won the International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition, championed by the chairman of its jury, Emil Gilels. Despite the prestige of this prize, he remained relatively unknown in the West. He did not defect, and under the Soviet regime his travelling was limited. After Perestroika, that began to change. Now he gives around eighty concerts a year and fans snap up his rare CDs, infrequent releases recorded live in concert. He doesn’t like to make studio recordings these days. The French director &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brunomonsaingeon.com/EN/PERFORMERS/G_SOKOLOV.html&quot;&gt;Bruno Monsaingeon&lt;/a&gt; captured on film a magical 2002 recital in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been suggested that he is the last great artist to emerge from the legendary “Russian school” of pianism, after such giants as Tatiana Nikolaeva, Richter, and Gilels. Sokolov himself discounts the tag. “It would be very strange if all the pianists from such a huge country as Russia could be put together and display a sign saying Russian school,” he says. “Musicians are individuals, and each one is very different. If we talk about a school in terms of what is taught in certain parts of the world, I think it does not make much sense. If we go to a museum, we see paintings by Rembrandt or Rubens, but also other paintings attributed to a “school of Rembrandt” or a “school of Rubens”. That means, in principle, that people belonging to a school did not have the personality for us to remember each one as an individual artist. Personality is what’s important in art.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Sokolov’s interpretations span a spiritual galaxy light years away from anyone else’s. It’s not only the vast range of his expressive capabilities, from the filigree ornamentations of works from the french baroque to the gargantuan power and ferocity of such works as prokofiev’s seventh and eighth sonatas, with the tone always speaking and rounded, no matter the volume. This is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, Sokolov has been labelled “eccentric”. He refuses to compromise his standards and so, to others, his demands may seem extreme. For instance, he likes to spend an entire day working with the piano in the hall before a concert, and instructs the tuner in precise detail about whai he needs from the instrument: “You need hours to understand the piano because each one has its own personality, and we play together,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-left&quot;&gt;


    &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/general/grigory-sokolov.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;








&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His exacting nature has spurred a decision to reduce the number of concertos he performs with orchestras. This sounds like a huge loss, but Sokolov says: “It’s very simple. For piano is written an ocean of music, and during your lifetime you are not able to play even a small part of it. When playing concertos, it’s not easy to find enough time to rehearse, or to find an orchestra which is interested in the final product and not looking at their watch. It’s also not easy with conductors, because you must find the combination of a very good musician who has this special talent to follow and to understand the music in the same way as you. It’s very seldom, I must say! And then maybe the worst: If you play a solo piece several limes over several days you will develop, going to another level with it. Bui with a concerto you play this piece more and more, bui with each orchestra and conductor you must start again from zero at ihe first rehearsal. So, if you spend so much energy that you could use much more effectively for recitals, why do you do it? I very much like the fact that everything I make depends only on me. With a hundred people it”s almost impossible. You have not the responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Sokolov, music remains fresh at every performance. Indeed, he feels it is impossible to play a piece the same way twice: “first, because every day we are something different,” he says. “next, you have another piano, and you play together with the piano; you have another concert hall and another acoustic. Even in the same hall on the same piano it can”t be the same.” His programme in Barcelona included music by Bach and Beethoven, with the second half consisting of the Schumann F sharp minor sonata - an unusual, problematic work, but in Sokolov’s hands full of exposed depths, ghostly voices and unimaginable tenderness. He does not wax lyrical about it in words, though. “It’s a beautiful piece,” he comments briefly. “Schumann is a very good brand!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His Bach is replete with intricate details and moments of startling poetry, delivered with a clarity that would turn many harpsichordists green with envy. I ask what he thinks about the era, now receding, in which purists habitually decreed the piano the wrong instrument for Bach. “I can’t believe that a young musician can grow up without playing Bach,” he begins. “If you’re not allowed to play Bach, then why can you play Chopin? Is that not allowed because it was another instrument in Chopin’s time? This is completely the wrong idea, as is the idea that it’s possible to have one museum interpretation. First of all, you can’t find an old instrument with a very good equivalent quality now. If you make a replica, it means that you have made a new instrument. Next, Bach was universal from the point of view of the instrument; each of his concertos for keyboard and orchestra were originally written for violin; some we know, some are lost. There is a wider distance from violin to keyboard instrument than from cembalo to piano. Back then the same piece was played on the clavichord, which was very popular because it was very close to violin; the system of the clavichord was that when you touched the string you made a vibration. The problem was that the sound was very limited and it was impossible to play in a bigger room. Then there was the chamber organ. Three keyboard instruments which are completely different. Next, on whichever instrument you play Bach, the public and you have another problem: you can never be the public of that time. That means that a museum interpretation is impossible. Of course, if you want the sound to be exactly like the cembalo, then play cembalo. If you play the piano and you don”t understand that the sound and other things have another nature, it’s also not the way. But if you enter the world of this composer, then you can play it on almost anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although in the past Sokolov has occasionally played programmes consisting of just one composer, he currently has no plans to join the roster of pianists performing complete cycles, such as all thirty-two Beethoven sonatas. “A pianist should only play what he or she feels inside. It must feel natural. I have played many of the Beethoven sonatas, and if I play in the end all of them, then maybe to play them together is ok. But every one of the piano sonatas of Beethoven represents a different world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His recitals usually end in standing ovations and a jamboree of encores. In Barcelona, we heard some astonishing Rameau, three Chopin impromptus, a mazurka or two, and a touching, quiet waltz. Why so many? Sokolov laughs: “I like to play piano,” he says, “so if people want …” and people certainly do. Sokolov’s magic is at last reaching music lovers across the globe, transforming our expectations of everything a piano recital can and should be. My final impression is of this last of the Russian titans approaching his tea in the same way he approaches his piano: pressing the teabag insistently, squeezing out every last drop of flavour.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Music" /><summary type="html">A FEW YEARS AGO, I heard Grigory Sokolov play for the first time. Everything I had ever learned, thought or felt about the piano and performance upon it went up in smoke. Sokolov, although a well-kept secret, is for many the greatest pianist alive today. Youthful celebrities with fast fingers, designer gear, and slick photos pall beside such gigantic artistry.</summary></entry></feed>
