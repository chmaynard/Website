<p><strong>Core Memory Music</strong> is looking for soloists and small ensembles to perform in our
chamber music series. We want to showcase your artistry and provide our audience with a
rich, varied mix of music each season.</p>

<p>Our concerts take place inside a <a href="this-new-house.html">modern home</a> in southern Rhode
Island, a few miles from the Atlantic coast. The performance space seats up to 30 people
and features a Steinway concert grand in excellent condition. Concerts are informal and we
encourage performers to interact with the audience.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/performance-space.png" alt="Performance Space" class="center" /></p>

<p>Our performance fees generally range from $400 to $1000 per artist. We take into account
factors such as recent recordings, training, and experience. We also provide meals,
lodging, and ground transportation while you’re here, and we’ll help with your travel
expenses. We’re currently seeking proposals for our 2027–2028 season.</p>

<p>If this opportunity interests you, <a href="mailto:corememorymusic@gmail.com?subject=Artist%20Proposal">introduce yourself</a> and describe your proposal.
Please include links to your website and to one or more recordings of recent performances.
If your proposal meets our requirements and seems likely to appeal to our audience, we’ll
ask you to schedule a phone meeting with us to get acquainted.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4 id="ive-been-invited-to-perform-what-happens-next">I’ve been invited to perform. What happens next?</h4>

<p>Please send us your proposed program at least 90 days before the date of the concert. If
we think your program needs to be revised, we’ll explain why and suggest some possible
changes. After we agree on the program, concert date, and performance fee, we’ll send you
a written agreement to review and sign.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-should-i-plan-to-perform">How long should I plan to perform?</h4>

<p>Please prepare a minimum of 60 minutes of music. Most of our concerts are divided into two
segments with a 15-minute intermission. Encores are optional but much appreciated by our
audience.</p>

<h4 id="where-is-the-concert-venue">Where is the concert venue?</h4>

<p>The address of the venue is <strong>103 North Road, Wakefield, Rhode Island 02879</strong>. Driving time
from Providence, Newport, Westerly, and southeastern Connecticut is under an hour,
and Amtrak’s <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/stations/kin" title="Kingston Station">Kingston Station</a> is only five miles away.</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/g77318Ud2csumT9h7" title="Map and Directions">Map and Directions</a></p>

<h4 id="when-should-i-arrive-at-the-venue">When should I arrive at the venue?</h4>

<p>Please plan to arrive at least three (3) hours before your performance is scheduled to
begin. If you’re traveling several hours to get here, we recommend that you arrive the day
before your concert. We’re happy to provide lodging at the venue for up to two nights.</p>

<h4 id="will-my-concert-be-recorded">Will my concert be recorded?</h4>

<p>We livestream and record our concerts (audio only). We use a simple two-mic system that
works best for soloists but can be used for ensembles as well. The quality is suitable for
private use. These recordings belong to you and will not be shared without your permission.</p>

<h4 id="are-complimentary-tickets-available">Are complimentary tickets available?</h4>

<p>We don’t sell tickets to our concerts — instead, patrons request a reservation and make a
financial contribution at the door. Please encourage your family and friends to join us and
contribute along with our other guests. Any amount is welcome.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-ever-postpone-or-cancel-concerts">Do you ever postpone or cancel concerts?</h4>

<p>In the unlikely event that we don’t get enough advance reservations, we may decide that your
concert is not financially viable. If that happens, we’ll pay you a portion of your
performance fee and ask you to re-schedule the concert.</p>

<h4 id="where-can-i-find-publicity-about-my-concert">Where can I find publicity about my concert?</h4>

<p>The most reliable source of concert information is the <a href="schedule.html">concert schedule</a> on our
website.</p>
