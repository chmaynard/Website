<p>In 2014, I was living in a small apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area, a few miles south
of Stanford University. I wanted to improve my quality of life by purchasing a home, but
real estate in the area was very expensive and prices were accelerating upwards. I decided
it was time to consider a move to a more affordable locale.</p>

<p>For a long time, I had wanted to live in New England. When an opportunity arose to purchase
an undeveloped property in southern Rhode Island, I jumped on it. This looked like a great
place to build an interesting new house. I wanted the home to be comfortable, quiet, and
energy-efficient. Beyond that, I was open to any and all ideas.</p>

<p>After a tour of a home site with an innovative local builder, I decided to design and build
a house that achieves (and hopefully exceeds) a very stringent set of requirements called
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house">Passive House building standard</a>. I
assembled a team of highly-qualified professionals who understood what we wanted to do and
were up to speed on the latest advances in science-based design and construction methods.</p>

<p>A Passive House typically uses 80-90% less energy than a conventional American home — hard
to believe, but true. The air inside the home is clean and safe, with very little
temperature variation (no hot or cold spots). Occupants aren’t bothered by pollen, excessive
humidity, or outside noise.</p>

<p>How does a Passive House achieve this?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Passive solar heating.</strong> The primary source of heat during the cooler
months is sunlight that enters through large, south-facing windows. Wide eaves
and other shading techniques are used to minimize solar gain during the warmer
months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Superinsulation.</strong> A passive house uses insulation with very high
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-value_(insulation)">R-values</a> around the main
envelope, including the foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Minimal thermal bridging.</strong> Passive house designers try very hard to
eliminate thermal bridging inside the main envelope. Thermal bridging occurs
when a conductive material extends from within the main envelope to the
outside air.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No leaks!</strong> The main envelope is virtually airtight, preventing
infiltration of outside air and loss of conditioned air.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>High-performance windows and doors.</strong> European-designed windows and
doors provide exceptional thermal and acoustical insulation. Features include
triple glazing, multiple gaskets, warm-edge spacers, and a multi-point locking
system to ensure a tight seal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Whole-house ventilation.</strong> An independent ventilation system exchanges
the air inside the main envelope every few hours, and includes subsystems for
air filtration, energy recovery, and dehumidification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supplemental heating and cooling.</strong> Small, ductless heat pumps called
mini-splits are used to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the home
regardless of outside conditions. When cooling the air inside the home, heat
pumps also help to reduce humidity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="powered-by-the-sun">Powered by the sun</h3>

<p>To reduce my dependence on power sources that emit greenhouse gases, I decided to generate
power on site using a photovoltaic system purchased from <a href="https://newportsolarri.com">Newport Solar</a>.
An array of thirty rooftop solar panels generate up to 9000 watts during daylight hours to
power the house and recharge the on-site energy storage system. Surplus power is sold to the local
electric utility.</p>

<p>The energy storage system uses lithium batteries that charge up during the day and supply
power to the house at night. During utility power outages, the batteries provide enough
auxiliary power to keep the house habitable. Residential energy storage systems are growing
in popularity as manufacturing costs come down; gas-powered portable generators will become a
thing of the past.</p>

<h3 id="do-we-really-need-a-concrete-slab">Do we really need a concrete slab?</h3>

<p>I wanted a hardwood floor in part of the finished basement, but hardwood on top of fresh
concrete is not recommended because the wood can swell and warp. Defying conventional
wisdom, we decided to build the basement floor without using concrete. Over seven years
later, the floor is still solid with no signs of unevenness.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/documents/basement-floor.pdf" type="application/pdf"><em>A Basement Floor Without Concrete</em></a>
 tells the full story.</p>
