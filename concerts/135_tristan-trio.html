With performances on the Bar Harbor Music Festival, Fermata Chamber Soloists and Red Door Chamber Music, the trio has stormed onto the music scene, quickly become a soughtafter ensemble known for “excellent emotional storytelling,” (Boston Musical Intelligencer). About the Artists Thomas Lee Cooper A violinist having “glimmering silver thread of tone,” (Boston Musical Intelligencer) with “dark grainy power” (The Arts Fuse) Thomas Lee Cooper brings lyrical intensity and refined artistry to every performance. A Boston area native, Thomas has performed across North America, Europe, and Asia.
