Sophia is a recipient of numerous prizes and awards, including a Juilliard Career Grant, the Borromeo Guest Artist Award, and top prizes at the Plowman, Fischoff, and Remember Enescu International Competitions.</p><p>Sophia began her violin studies by choice at the age of 3, the fourth generation of a musical family. Her proudest musical moment was performing her grandfather Sandor Szokolay’s Violin Concerto with the Győr Philharmonic Orchestra in Hungary, which was the last concert he attended before peacefully passing in 2013.</p><p>Sophia holds a Bachelor of Music degree from the New England Conservatory with a minor in music theory. Her teachers included Catherine Cho, Victor Dancheko, Miriam Fried, Barry Shiffman and Donald Weilerstein. She is currently finishing a Master of Music degree at The Juilliard School as a Irene Diamond Graduate Fellow.</p><p><br /></p><h3 id="ying-li">Ying Li</h3><div class="figure align-left"><figure> <img src="/assets/images/performer/ying-li.jpg" /></figure></div><p>Chinese pianist Ying Li entered the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia in 2012 as a student of Robert McDonald, Seymour Lipkin, and Jonathan Biss.
