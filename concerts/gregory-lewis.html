<p>Cellist Stephen Perkyns has performed in chamber music series such as the Colburn Chamber Music
Society, won chamber music competitions such as Colburn’s Recovered Voices Competition, and
collaborated with artists such as Noah Bendix-Balgley, Desmond Hoebig, Kathleen Winkler, Scott St.

<p>Carter Johnson began the study of piano at age five with Shelley Roberts (with whom he studied for
twelve years), continued studies with Michelle Mares, and then with Mark Anderson at the University
of British Columbia, where he received a Bachelor of Music in piano performance. His areas of
special interest include the music of J.S. Bach, Brahms, Schumann, contemporary music, and art song
(recently, he performed the complete song repertoire of Duparc).</p>

<p>In addition to his musical career, Johnson is an accomplished actor and speaker: he holds his ATCL
with Distinction in Speech and Drama from Trinity College London and has won many awards for his
performances of Shakespeare—combining this experience with his passion for educating audiences, his
discussions on music have become a highlight of his recitals for many concertgoers.</p>

<p>Johnson lives with his wife Hannah and their sons Preston and Ambrose in New York City where he is
active as a soloist, collaborator, and teacher. He is currently pursuing a Master of Music degree at
the Juilliard School, studying with Joseph Kalichstein and Matti Raekallio.</p>
