Oliver is a current student of Mihaela Martin at the Kronberg Academy and a graduate of the Juilliard School where he studied with Li Lin, Itzhak Perlman, and Donald Weilerstein, and was a recipient of the Kovner Fellowship. Oliver has performed as soloist with numerous orchestras, including the National Repertory Orchestra, the Sound Symphony Orchestra, the Symphony of Westchester, the Springfield Symphony, and the Juilliard AXIOM Ensemble. He has captured top prizes in the Hellam Competition, ArsClassica International Competition, National YoungArts Competition, and received the Prix de l’APCAV at the Verbier Festival. Oliver has appeared at festivals including the Marlboro Music Festival, Verbier Academy, Kronberg Masterclasses, Music@Menlo, and Chamber Music Northwest. Highlights of Oliver’s upcoming season include his YCA Recital Debuts at Merkin Hall and the Kennedy Center’s Terrace Theater as well as concerto debuts with the Delaware Symphony and the Chamber Orchestra of the Triangle. He will also be making his recital debut in Carnegie’s Weill Hall as recipient of the Juilliard School’s 2024 Gershen Cohen Award.

Janice Carissa A Gilmore Young Artist and Salon de Virtuosi recipient, Indonesian pianist Janice Carissa is celebrated for her ability to craft vivid musical narratives that transcend mere virtuosity (Chicago Classical Review). She has performed for the President of Indonesia at the Presidential Palace Indonesia, and earned ovations in the United Nations, Carnegie Hall, Sydney Opera House and Louis Vuitton Foundation, among others. Following her Philadelphia Orchestra debut at sixteen, which earned praise from the Philadelphia Inquirer for “radiating the multicolored highlights of a mature pianist,” she has collaborated with luminaries including Stéphane Denève, Cristian Măcelaru, Peter Oundjian, Osmo Vänskä, and Jahja Ling; stepped in for Andre Watts with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra; and featured as a soloist with the Kansas City, Nashville, Curtis, Promusica, Amarillo, Sacramento, Kalamazoo, Bay Atlantic, Battlecreek, Symphony in C, and Tacoma symphonies. Equally at home in intimate settings, Carissa is a sought-after chamber musician and has collaborated with Vadim Gluzman, Miriam Fried, Pamela Frank, David Shifrin, Marcy Rosen, Paul Neubauer, Shmuel Ashkenazy, Zlatomir Fung, Lucy Shelton and members of the Berlin Philharmonic’s Scharoun Ensemble. Her versatility and deep commitment to collaboration has been showcased at the Marlboro, Ravinia, Bravo! Vail, Caramoor, North Shore, and Kneisel Hall festivals. Carissa is a member of an American collective of soloists and chamber musicians called Ensemble 132, and appears regularly with the Jupiter Chamber Players. Born in Surabaya, Indonesia, Carissa began her piano studies under her mother’s guidance. Now settled in New York, she moved to the United States at fifteen to study at the Curtis Institute of Music with Gary Graffman and Robert McDonald, later completing her Master’s at The Juilliard School as a Kovner Fellow. Her journey has been enriched by support from the Lang Lang and Lieven Foundations, as well as mentorship from Eliso Virsaladze, Ingrid Fliter, Alon Goldstein, Davide Cabassi, Claudio Martinez-Mehner, Andreas Staier, and Tatiana Zelikmann. When away from the stage, Carissa enjoys immersing herself in the world of food and photography." />
