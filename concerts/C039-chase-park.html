Performances through Curtis on Tour brought him to international stages in Athens, Paris, Kempten, Teulada, and Berlin, in 2019 launching his international reputation. Chase began his musical studies at the age of four with Madeleine Golz at the Thurnauer School of Music. After his acceptance to the Perlman Music Program at the age of eleven, Chase continued his studies with Dr. Minhye Clara Kim at the Juilliard School’s Pre College Division. In addition to his lessons with Dr. Kim, Chase studied extensively with legendary cellists Ronald Leonard and Paul Katz until his acceptance at the Curtis Institute of Music. At Curtis, Chase spent much of his time playing for Pamela Frank, which was instrumental in his development as an interpreter and chamber musician. He is currently pursuing his masters degree at the Juilliard School back with Dr. Kim. Chase devotes all of his study to exploring new sound worlds and imagining ways of relating what he hears and sees to his listeners. He is currently immersed in the sound of cello and is working towards adapting film to all of the pieces he has explored since the pandemic.
