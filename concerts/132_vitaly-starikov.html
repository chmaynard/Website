<meta name="description" content="Join us for a piano recital featuring Vitaly Starikov, silver medalist at the 2025 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. Mr. Starikov appears by special arrangement with The Cliburn Competition. Program About the Artist Vitaly Starikov About the Concert Program Composer Work Year Johann Sebastian Bach Italian Concerto, BWV 971 1735 Dmitri Shostakovich Piano Sonata No. 2 in B minor, Op. 61 1943 Intermission Claude Debussy Études, L. 136 1915 About the Artist Vitaly Starikov Pianist Vitaly Starikov has found distinction with “raw, deeply felt, and powerful” (La Scena) performances, while having an unassuming onstage presence and a “willingness less to play at the audience than to draw [them] into musical intimacies” (Dallas Morning News). His bold approach won him silver at the 2025 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition and the admiration of fans around the globe. Vitaly’s perspective on music is manifested in his repertoire: he presents music that reflects not only tradition, but also contemporary life, striving to offer new perspectives on familiar music and introduce lesser-known pieces to wider audiences. His Cliburn performance of Bartok’s Second Piano Concerto electrified the room, with a La Scena reviewer noting that “he understood this music, and gave an impactful, lively, and gripping interpretation on all levels: emotionally, architecturally, and in terms of his sound palette.” Recital and chamber music appearances have taken him around the world, notably to Austria, Australia, Slovakia, Israel, Cyprus, Italy, France, Belgium, and Malaysia, with highlights including Sydney Opera House, Queen Elisabeth Hall, and the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. He has performed with the Antwerp and Belgian National Orchestras, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Belarusian State Symphony Orchestra, and St. Petersburg Symphony, and toured with the Orchestre national de Metz Grand Est. This inaugural Cliburn season takes him to the Bravo! Vail and Sunriver Music Festivals; Colorado Springs Philharmonic, and Pacific, Topeka, and Springfield Symphony Orchestras, and in recitals throughout the United States. About the Concert The performance begins at 3:00 pm. Join us an hour earlier for a pre-concert discussion about the music on the program. After the performance, you’ll have an opportunity to meet the artist(s) and learn about their backgrounds, interests, and career plans. The address of the venue is 103 North Road, Wakefield, Rhode Island 02879. Driving time from Providence, Newport, Westerly, and southeastern Connecticut is under an hour, and Amtrak’s Kingston Station is only five miles away. Map and Directions The suggested contribution for this concert is $40 per person, collected at the door. We accept cash, personal checks, and cards. Checks should be payable to “Core Memory Music”.
