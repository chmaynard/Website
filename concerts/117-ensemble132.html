Sahun Hong) 1911 Petrushka (arr. Sahun Hong) 1911 Intermission Clara Schumann Three Romances, Op. 22 1853 Johannes Brahms Piano Quintet in F minor, Op. 34 1864 Full Program (PDF) About the Ensemble ensemble132 is an American collective of soloists and chamber musicians of the highest caliber, uniting with a shared mission to reimagine the chamber music landscape. The only group of its kind to continually create and premiere new standards in the chamber music repertoire with its artist-crafted arrangements, ensemble132 excites the imagination of audiences across the country with its uniquely genre-defying programs. At every e132 event, audiences can expect a one-of-a-kind chamber music experience characterized by ensemble132’s versatile artistry and limitless programming possibilities. Chamber ballets, transcriptions of symphonies and jazz standards, and orchestrations of works comprise just a few of ensemble132’s programming highlights. Each member of ensemble132’s dynamic roster, all with stellar careers and accolades, brings their unique blend of uncompromising individuality and collaborative spirit to traditional masterworks as well as unearthed gems. The group’s arrangements have been praised by critics and renowned musicians alike as “Audacious… liberating … illuminating” (Jon Sobel), “absolutely terrific … a delight … [they] succeed in opening up the sound of the piece in meaningful ways” (Robert McDonald), and “a fresh approach to music that is second to none” (Herbert Greenberg). The artists of ensemble132 have collaborated closely at music festivals such as Marlboro, Ravinia, Music@Menlo, Verbier, and Taos, and they appear regularly with ensembles such as the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Catalyst Quartet, Borromeo String Quartet, and Orpheus Chamber Orchestra.
