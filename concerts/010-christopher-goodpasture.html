The Toronto Concert Review described his playing as a “rare combination of strength, energy and sublime musical sensitivity…matched by a heavenly sense of melodic line”. His imaginative approach to programming reflects a penchant for unusual repertoire and narrative that is both unconventional and provocative. He has performed recitals in concert venues throughout North America, including the Kennedy Center (Washington D.C.), Benaroya Hall (Seattle), Koerner Hall (Toronto), Alice Tully Hall, Merkin Hall, Weill Recital Hall (New York), Bing Concert Hall (San Francisco), and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Recent and upcoming orchestral appearances include concertos with the Sioux City Symphony, The Oakville Symphony, Northumberland Orchestra, Acadiana Symphony Orchestra, and the Chamber Orchestra of New York. Among his forthcoming projects is an album to be released on Yarlung Records entitled Pollination, an exploration of sound world and atmosphere seen through the eyes of composers including Bartók, Janáček, Debussy, Haydn, Takemitsu and Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe. From a young age, Christopher developed a keen interest in collaboration and now is a sought-after chamber musician, having played for and collaborated with a number of noted musicians. He has appeared as a fellow in Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute, in the intensive chamber music program of David Finckel and Wu Han in Aspen, at the Music Academy of the West, and in the festivals of Kneisel Hall, Sarasota and Banff. Among his collaborators are members of the Takacs, Ysaye, St. Lawrence, Amenda, Guarneri, and Tokyo String Quartets. Christopher’s work with pianists Seymour Lipkin, Joseph Kalichstein, Robert Levin, Claude Frank, Leon Fleisher and violinists Pamela Frank and Sylvia Rosenberg has left a meaningful impact on his work as a chamber musician. Born in Los Angeles, California, Christopher’s formal training began at the Pasadena Conservatory, where he enrolled in theory, chamber music, and for four years, composition with award-winning American composer, Andrew Norman. He continued his studies with Stewart Gordon and John Perry at the University of Southern California and the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. Christopher holds graduate degrees from Yale University and The Juilliard School, where his teachers included Hung-Kuan Chen, Peter Frankl, Jerome Lowenthal and Christopher Elton." />
