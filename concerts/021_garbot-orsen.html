He has soloed with the Oregon Symphony, Jefferson Symphony, and on tour with the Curtis Chamber Orchestra. Mr. Garbot has been a guest musician with The Philadelphia Orchestra and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. He has performed and collaborated with members the Artemis and Belcea Quartets, as well as Shmuel Ashkenasi, Timothy Eddy, Viviane Hagner, Hsin-Yun Huang, Kim Kashkashian, Steven Tenenbom, and Jason Vieaux. He has performed at Music@Menlo, Ravinia, Krzyzowa-Music Festival, Perlman Music Program, Rheingau Musik Festival, and Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Mr. Garbot’s performances have been featured on APM’s Performance Today and WHYY’s On Stage at Curtis. Brandon Garbot recently graduated from the Curtis Insti- tute of Music as a student of Ida Kavafian and Arnold Steinhardt. He has previously studied with Catherine Cho, Itzhak Perlman, and William Preucil. Daniel Orsen Violist Daniel Orsen is based in Boston, Massachusetts. This season, Daniel will play a series of concerts as guest violist of the Arctic Philharmonic Sinfonietta in Bodø, Norway. He also frequently performs as a substitute violist with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and on various concert series in the Boston area. As a chamber musician, Daniel has performed along side artists such as Itzhak Perlman, Kim Kashkashian, Donald Weilerstein, and the Jasper String Quartet. His flute-viola-harp trio, OWL riot, was selected as a 2018 NEC Honors Ensemble. Festival credits include Kryzyzowa Music, Ravinia Steeans Music Institute, IMS Prussia Cove, and the Perlman Music Program. As soloist, Daniel has performed with Oberlin’s Contemporary Music Ensemble and the Pittsburgh Civic Orchestra, and is a first prize winner of the ASTA National Competition. Daniel has a few silly arrangements and transcriptions to his name, including his “Fledermaus Fantasy” for viola and piano, and a five-viola version of Weber’s “Andante et Rondo Ungarese.” A native of Pittsburgh, PA, Daniel began performing on percussion at three years of age, had a disastrous encounter with the piano at age five, and started the viola at age eight-and for some reason, probably Beethoven’s string quartets, it stuck. He received his BM from Oberlin studying with Peter Slowik, and MM from New England Conservatory studying with Kim Kashkashian." />
