Faculty and students from the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia will perform selections from the song cycle <em>Italienisches Liederbuch</em> (“Italian Songbook”) by the 19th-century Austrian composer Hugo Wolf.</p><p>This song cycle is a work of great drama, as a young couple rejects, and finally accepts, the many aspects of falling in love. The artists will perform the songs in dramatic dialogue, a kind of mini-opera.
