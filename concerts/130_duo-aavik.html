<meta name="description" content="Join us for a performance by Duo Aavik, violinist Hans Christian Aavik and pianist Karolina Aavik. This will be their first public recital in North America. The duo appears by special arrangement with Greator Productions OÜ. Program About the Ensemble About the Concert Program Composer Work Year Fritz Kreisler Viennese Rhapsodic Fantasietta 1948 Erkki-Sven Tüür Piano Sonata No. 1 1985 Edvard Grieg Violin Sonata No. 1 in F major, Op. 8 1865 Intermission Fritz Kreisler Slavonic Fantasy 1914 Arvo Pärt Fratres 1977 George Enescu Violin Sonata No. 3 in A minor, Op. 25 1926 About the Ensemble Duo Aavik - Hans Christian Aavik (violin) and Karolina Aavik (piano) - is among the most original of the new generation, characterised by fresh ideas, a versatile repertoire and the courage to take risks. The duo’s repertoire is delicately crafted, yet the musicians’ interpretation remains free and imaginative. In 2022, Duo Aavik recorded a live concert for Deutsche Grammophon’s new series “Rising Stars”. The recording was released in March this year. Since January 2023, Duo Aavik participates in the music endowment residency programme of the Cultural Endowment of Estonia. In addition, there will be performances at the Casals Forum, the festival Odessa Classics, the prestigious Robert Schumann Society concert series, as well as Estonia, Vanemuine and Jõhvi concert halls. The duo attaches great importance to the performance of new Estonian music and has commissioned works by Kristjan Randalu, Tõnu Kõrvits and Rein Rannap, which will be performed in the coming seasons. Duo Aavik’s collaboration began in 2014, when both musicians were still studying at the Tallinn Music High School. The violinist and the pianist are united by their humility towards the music, immersion in the work and its context. Listening to the duo is captivating due to their natural and sincere feel for the music, as well as their brilliant virtuosity and refined sound. Both musicians are currently studying at the Academy of Music and Theatre in Frankfurt, Germany, with Professors Erik Schumann and Angelika Merkle, and at the Kronberg Academy, which has been called the new Mecca for chamber music. The ensemble has also been greatly influenced by their studies in Vienna. Their interpretative style is a unique symbiosis of German and Viennese tradition, combining the depth of the German education, the profundity of the musical text with the elegance and unconstrained Viennese style. Duo Aavik has won numerous prizes and awards at national and international competitions and has performed on internationally renowned concert stages. The duo has also performed at the Pärnu Music Festival, the Usedom Music Festival and at MuseumsSalon in Frankfurt. Hans Christian Aavik and Karolina Aavik have studied with many famous musicians, including Christoph Eschenbach, Steven Isserlis, Kirill Gerstein, Antoine Tamestit and Julian Rachlin. They have had fruitful collaborations with the Eesti Kontsert, Tallinn Philharmonic and Klassikaraadio. Both musicians are outstanding soloists, with Hans Christian winning first prize in the 2022 Carl Nielsen International Competition. In 2021, they released the CD “Aeternus” featuring music by Bach, Pärt and Schubert. Hans Christian Aavik plays on a violin by Giovanni Paolo Maggini ( ca. 1610), with the kind permission of the Estonian Instrument Foundation and the Sapožnin family, and uses a bow made by Victor Fétique (ca. 1930). As of 2019, Karolina and Hans Christian Aavik are part of the society Live Music Now Yehudi Menuhin, which includes a charity programme that enables young and talented musicians to share their musical talents with people who don’t normally have access to them. About the Concert The performance begins at 3:00 pm. Join us an hour earlier for a pre-concert discussion about the music on the program.
