Highly versatile in their performing capacities, Tekalli Duo has appeared as duo soloists with orchestra, recitalists, educators, and American musical ambassadors abroad.

Their recitals have been presented by Concert Artists Guild in NYC, as well as the Odeon and Woodbridge Chamber Series.

Under the auspices of the United States Embassy as a musical exchange of Western and Middle Eastern music, Tekalli Duo appeared as performers in pre-revolutionary Libya at the University of Tripoli. In the fall of 2015, they performed a recital live on WFMT radio in Chicago as part of the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts.</p><p>Tekalli Duo’s repertoire includes the duo concerto and sonata repertory of the classics through romantic, 20th century and contemporary periods. Their recitals invariably mix standard classical repertory with newer works by composers of their heritage such as Fazil Say and Takemitsu, as well as their own transcriptions of classical and contemporary music.</p></section><section> <br> <br> <br><div id="shaded-box"> <b>Core Memory Music</b> relies on private communications and word of mouth to publicize our activities.
