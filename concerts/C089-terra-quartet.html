Their name is a nod to their multicultural origins; together, this foursome represents five continents and speaks six languages. Praised for their “remarkable maturity and musicality” and “superb ensemble playing” (Hyde Park Herald, Chicago), these four musicians, through their unique individuality as artists, are committed to infusing the string quartet with equal parts passion, vitality, and humor. Storytelling and spontaneity are at the heart of TSQ’s music making and they craft programs so as to tell a unique tale about the people, places, and ideas behind great works of the past and masterpieces of the present. TSQ has performed at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, at Alice Tully Hall with cellist Natasha Brofsky as part of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts’s “Wednesdays at One” series, and as part of the Four Seasons Chamber Music Festival’s Winter Workshop in North Carolina, where they performed with Robert McDonald. They have also appeared in concert with Quartetto di Cremona. Their mentors and coaches include Daniel Avshalomov and Laurie Carney of the American String Quartet, Mark Steinberg and Nina Lee of the Brentano Quartet, Ara Gregorian, Hye-Jin Kim, Philip Setzer, Calvin Wiersma, Natasha Brofsky, Catherine Cho, and Joseph Lin.
