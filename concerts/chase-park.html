<p>Exciting young cellist and passionate learner, <a href="https://www.chaseparkcello.com">Chase Park</a> is a
graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music’s Valerija and Ladislaus Medveckis Fellowship, where he
studied with Peter Wiley and Carter Brey. Performances through Curtis on Tour brought him to
international stages in Athens, Paris, Kempten, Teulada, and Berlin, in 2019 launching his
international reputation.</p>

<p>Chase began his musical studies at the age of four with Madeleine Golz at the Thurnauer School of
Music. After his acceptance to the Perlman Music Program at the age of eleven, Chase continued his
studies with Dr. Minhye Clara Kim at the Juilliard School’s Pre College Division. In addition to his
lessons with Dr. Kim, Chase studied extensively with legendary cellists Ronald Leonard and Paul Katz
until his acceptance at the Curtis Institute of Music. At Curtis, Chase spent much of his time
playing for Pamela Frank, which was instrumental in his development as an interpreter and chamber
musician. He is currently pursuing his masters degree at the Juilliard School back with Dr. Kim.</p>

<p>Chase devotes all of his study to exploring new sound worlds and imagining ways of relating what he
hears and sees to his listeners. He is currently immersed in the sound of solo cello and is working
towards adapting film to all of the pieces he has explored since the pandemic.</p>
