This season, Juliette will perform the role of Delphine Garnier in Les Demoiselles de Rochefort at the prestigious Théâtre Lido 2 Paris and will embark on a U.S. tour featuring recitals and chamber music concerts. During the 2024–2025 season, she appeared in Paris with Opéra Fuoco under the guidance of David Stern, collaborating with Laurent Naouri and Elsa Rooke in operatic scenes by Jules Massenet. She also gave a recital at the Château d’Écouen near Paris and performed as the soprano soloist in William Boyce’s Solomon at the Opéra de Massy. That same season, she made role debuts as Susanna (Le nozze di Figaro) under Nicholas McGegan, and in Candide conducted by David Charles Abell with the Curtis Opera Theatre.
