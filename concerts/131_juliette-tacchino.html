<p>Described by Le Devoir as “an outstanding actress with impeccable projection and style,” soprano Juliette Tacchino is distinguished by her artistic refinement and captivating stage presence. Winner of the Special Jury Prize at the 2024 Sumi Jo International Singing Competition and laureate of the 2024 French Riviera Masters Competition at the Opéra de Nice Côte d’Azur, she is rapidly establishing a flourishing international career.</p>

<p>Born into a family of musicians, Juliette began her vocal journey with the Children’s Chorus of the Opéra de Nice. During her studies, she performed the roles of Ilia (Idomeneo), Pauline (La Vie Parisienne), Phani (Les Indes Galantes), a nymph (The Fairy Queen), and appeared as soloist in a contemporary work by Canadian composer Ana Sokolović. She is a two-time First Prize winner at the Concours d’Opéra Bouffe de Québec (2020, 2022), and a recipient of the Louise Roy Scholarship, the Azrieli Foundation Grant, and the 2026 Laureate distinction from the Cercle Richard Wagner Rive Droite.</p>

<p>Highlights from recent seasons include concert performances as Mélisande (Pelléas et Mélisande) and Sophie (Der Rosenkavalier) with the Curtis Symphony Orchestra conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, as well as staged appearances in the roles of Ginevra (Ariodante), Thérèse (Les Mamelles de Tirésias), the Vixen (The Cunning Little Vixen), and as a soloist in a production of Handel’s L’Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato.
