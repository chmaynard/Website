Starr Doctoral Fellow at The Juilliard School, cellist Samuel DeCaprio is quickly establishing himself as one of today’s most creative artists and collaborators. With performances taking place from the jungles of Bali to the meditative depths of an underground New York City crypt to Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall, he aspires to use his voice to bring the works of composers, both revered and underrepresented, to uplift modern audiences. Winner of the 2018 Aldo Parisot Prize from the Yale School of Music, awarded to “gifted cellists who show promise for concert careers,” he hopes to reach and inspire new listeners as an ambassador for classical music.

Mr. DeCaprio holds degrees from the University of Connecticut (Bachelor of Music, summa cum laude), Eastman School of Music (Master of Music), Mannes School of Music (Professional Studies Diploma), and Yale School of Music (Master of Musical Arts).

Embracing a broad range of the classical music literature, her programs feature works ranging from the early French Baroque by Rameau, to Beethoven sonatas, to new music by living composers including South Korean classical composer, Unsuk Chin. After winning first prize at the 2019 Hilton Head International Piano Competition, Chaeyoung presented her debut recital at Carnegie Hall and performed Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 4 with the Hilton Head Symphony Orchestra under the baton of John Morris Russell. Her debut album was released in 2021 on the Steinway label. Chaeyoung regularly performs with American orchestras, including the Juilliard chamber orchestra, Rochester Philharmonic, Utah Symphony Orchestra, and Hilton Head Symphony Orchestra. An avid chamber musician, Chaeyoung has participated in Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute, Kneisel Hall, Juilliard ChamberFest, and YoungArts Week, which awarded her the prestigious Gold Medal in Music. South Korean-born and raised in Lawrence, Kansas since age ten, Park returns to Kansas frequently to share music with her community. She is currently based in New York City." />
