This season, Daniel will play a series of concerts as guest solo violist of the Arctic Philharmonic Sinfonietta in Bodø, Norway. He also frequently performs as a substitute violist with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and on various concert series in the Boston area.</p><p>As a chamber musician, Daniel has performed along side artists such as Itzhak Perlman, Kim Kashkashian, Donald Weilerstein, and the Jasper String Quartet. His flute-viola-harp trio, OWL riot, was selected as a 2018 NEC Honors Ensemble. Festival credits include Kryzyzowa Music, Ravinia Steeans Music Institute, IMS Prussia Cove, and the Perlman Music Program.</p><p>As soloist, Daniel has performed with Oberlin’s Contemporary Music Ensemble and the Pittsburgh Civic Orchestra, and is a first prize winner of the ASTA National Solo Competition.</p><p>Daniel has a few silly arrangements and transcriptions to his name, including his “Fledermaus Fantasy” for viola and piano, and a five-viola version of Weber’s “Andante et Rondo Ungarese.”</p><p>A native of Pittsburgh, PA, Daniel began performing on percussion at three years of age, had a disastrous encounter with the piano at age five, and started the viola at age eight-and for some reason, probably Beethoven’s string quartets, it stuck. He received his BM from Oberlin studying with Peter Slowik, and MM from New England Conservatory studying with Kim Kashkashian.</p></section><section> <br> <br> <br><div id="shaded-box"> <b>Core Memory Music</b> relies on private communications and word of mouth to publicize our activities.
