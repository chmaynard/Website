Named Yamaha’s 2020 Young Performing Artist for Classical Music/Violin, she has performed on three continents, performing in recital and as the featured soloist with numerous orchestras throughout the United States, China, and Europe. She appeared as a guest artist at the Peninsula Music Festival, Harpa International Academy Festival, Brevard Music Festival and made her Aspen Music Festival debut as the recipient of the prestigious 2019 Dorothy DeLay Fellowship Award, performing the Glazunov Violin Concerto with the Aspen Philharmonic Orchestra. Highlights of Maya’s upcoming engagements include performances with the Greenwich (CT), Battle Creek (MI), and Galveston (TX) Symphony Orchestras. She has also performed recently with the Evanston and Grand Rapids Symphony and the Symphony Orchestra of India in Mumbai. At sixteen, she won First Prize in the 2017 Crain-Maling Foundation Chicago Symphony Orchestra Young Artist Competition and made her debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She is the top medalist of the 2018 Washington International Competition, 2018 Stulberg International String Competition, 2016 Stradivarius International Violin Competition and 2015 Johansen International Competition. Maya is an alumnus of both the 2020 Menuhin International Violin Competition and the 2022 International Violin Competition of Indianapolis. To broaden Western classical music traditions, Maya incorporates the music of her heritage by presenting pieces unique to her Indian ancestry in recital, bridging her Eastern roots with her Western classical training.

An alumna of the Music Institute of Chicago Academy, she studied with Almita Vamos. She currently attends the Curtis Institute of Music in the studio of Ida Kavafian.

She recalls a pivotal moment in her childhood when she was driven home from a concert, and her father asked what her favorite part of performing was. They both were pleasantly surprised with her response—the thing she looked forward to the most was the thrill of walking onto a stage.
