<h2 id="about-the-music">About the Music</h2>

<h3 id="the-red-violin-caprices">The Red Violin Caprices</h3>

<p>These Caprices, composed in conjunction with the score for François Girard’s
film The Red Violin, take a spacious, troubadour-inspired theme and vary it
both linearly and stylistically. These variations intentionally evoke Baroque,
Gypsy, and arch-Romantic idioms as they examine the same materials (a dark,
seven-chord chaconne as well as that principal theme) from differing aural
viewpoints.</p>

<p>The Caprices were created and ordered to reflect the structure of the film, in
which Bussotti, a fictional 18th-century violin maker, crafts his greatest
violin for his soon-to-be-born son. When tragedy claims wife and child, the
grief-stricken Bussotti, in a gesture both ardent and macabre, infuses the
blood of his beloved into the varnish of the instrument. Their fates thus
joined, the violin travels across three centuries through Vienna, London,
Shanghai and Montreal, passing through the hands of a doomed child prodigy, a
flamboyant virtuoso, a haunted Maoist commissar, and at last a willful
Canadian expert, whose own plans for the violin finally complete the circle of
parent and child united in art.</p>
