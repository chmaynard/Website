Merz Trio are passionately committed to reshaping the narrative of classical music through vibrantly dynamic programming and wide-ranging interdisciplinary collaboration. Their narrative programming style juxtaposes classical standards, new music, and their own arrangements of familiar and forgotten works, fluidly interwoven and guided with speaking from the Trio’s members. Their interdisciplinary collaborations include ongoing projects with directors Emma Jaster and Jon Levin, dancer Caroline Copeland, and Sandglass Puppet Theater. The Trio are equally known for their more immersive integrations of music and text in performance, ranging from their recital-theater piece built around Shakespeare’s Macbeth (“Those Secret Eyes”), to their debut album interweaving Ravel’s Trio with short pieces, poems, and diaries of the era (“Ink,” August, 2021), to be presented in a live concert format (“Ink Spills”) for the 2021-2022 season. Finally, in their prolific arranging, the Trio are committed to uplifting overlooked voices from history, ranging from Hildegard von Bingen to Lili and Nadia Boulanger, from Joséphine Baker to Irish folk melodies. This coming season, Merz Trio look forward to debuts at Tippet Rise, Duke Performances, CM Dallas, Coleman Chamber Music Association, the New Orleans Friends of Music and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Recent debuts have taken them to Carnegie Hall, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Chamber Music Houston, Philadelphia CMS, and the Schubert Club (St. Paul, MN), among other notable performances. Merz Trio have been encouraged in their explorations by numerous institutional homes around the world: New England Conservatory, Yellow Barn, Snape Maltings, Avaloch Farm Institute, the Naumburg Foundation, the Lake Champlain, Olympic, and Chesapeake Music Festivals, and the Fischoff Competition, as well as many other venues and hosts around the US, Australia, the Netherlands and the UK.

She has performed as a concerto soloist with orchestras including the New World Symphony Orchestra, Central Florida Symphony Orchestra, and Northwestern University Symphony Orchestra.

Amy Yang Praised by the Washington Post as a “jaw-dropping pianist who steals the show…with effortless finesse,” pianist Amy Yang joined forces with the Curtis Symphony Orchestra under Osmo Vänskä playing Schumann’s Piano Concerto at Verizon Hall at the Kimmel Center in 2023. Additionally, she gave the world premiere of Richard Danielpour’s “Four Portraits” for piano at the Curtis Institute of Music, where she is a faculty member and the Associate Dean of Piano Studies and Artistic Initiatives.

She has appeared as a soloist with the Houston Symphony, and presented recitals for Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, Texas Music Festival, Kosciuszko Foundation and Coastal Concerts. She has premiered and recorded music by Caroline Shaw, Avner Dorman, Michael Hersch, Ezra Laderman, and commissioned works from Alistair Coleman, Edward Babcock, and Hua Yang.

Her past teachers include Li Qing, Timothy Hester, Claude Frank, Robert McDonald, and Peter Frankl. Ardent to champion young voices on this pedagogical legacy, her own students have soloed with the Philadelphia Orchestra and entered Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Bard Conservatory, Vanderbilt University Blair School of Music, Eastman School of Music, Peabody Institute, and Indiana University.

She won the 2018 Musical Fund Society prize and the Kosciuszko National Chopin Piano Competition. When not serving the various keyboards related to her roles, her intentionally incognito presence may be revealed by a quivering Micron pen as she sketches from the back of concert halls. The work of a lifetime is where she hopes to question, explore, and linger every day." />

<p>Hailed as “entrancing” (BBC Music Magazine) and “artists in the deepest sense of the word” (CutCommon), Merz Trio, winners of the Naumburg, Concert Artists Guild, Fischoff and Chesapeake Competitions, and recipients of a Salon di Virtuosi Career Grant, have been lauded for their “stunning virtuosity … fresh and surprising interpretations” (Reading Eagle), and “perfection of intonation and ensemble” (Hudson Review).</p>

<p>Merz Trio are passionately committed to reshaping the narrative of classical music through vibrantly dynamic programming and wide-ranging interdisciplinary collaboration. Their narrative programming style juxtaposes classical standards, new music, and their own arrangements of familiar and forgotten works, fluidly interwoven and guided with speaking from the Trio’s members. Their interdisciplinary collaborations include ongoing projects with directors Emma Jaster and Jon Levin, dancer Caroline Copeland, and Sandglass Puppet Theater.</p>

<p>The Trio are equally known for their more immersive integrations of music and text in performance, ranging from their recital-theater piece built around Shakespeare’s Macbeth (“Those Secret Eyes”), to their debut album interweaving Ravel’s Trio with short pieces, poems, and diaries of the era (“Ink,” August, 2021), to be presented in a live concert format (“Ink Spills”) for the 2021-2022 season. Finally, in their prolific arranging, the Trio are committed to uplifting overlooked voices from history, ranging from Hildegard von Bingen to Lili and Nadia Boulanger, from Joséphine Baker to Irish folk melodies.</p>

<p>This coming season, Merz Trio look forward to debuts at Tippet Rise, Duke Performances, CM Dallas, Coleman Chamber Music Association, the New Orleans Friends of Music and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Recent debuts have taken them to Carnegie Hall, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Chamber Music Houston, Philadelphia CMS, and the Schubert Club (St. Paul, MN), among other notable performances.</p>

<p>Merz Trio have been encouraged in their explorations by numerous institutional homes around the world: New England Conservatory, Yellow Barn, Snape Maltings, Avaloch Farm Institute, the Naumburg Foundation, the Lake Champlain, Olympic, and Chesapeake Music Festivals, and the Fischoff Competition, as well as many other venues and hosts around the US, Australia, the Netherlands and the UK.</p>

<p>Merz Trio operate as a nonprofit organization under Project Merz, Inc. and are currently represented by Concert Artists Guild.</p>

<p>Praised by the Washington Post as a “jaw-dropping pianist who steals the show…with effortless finesse,” pianist Amy Yang joined forces with the Curtis Symphony Orchestra under Osmo Vänskä playing Schumann’s Piano Concerto at Verizon Hall at the Kimmel Center in 2023. Additionally, she gave the world premiere of Richard Danielpour’s “Four Portraits” for piano at the Curtis Institute of Music, where she is a faculty member and the Associate Dean of Piano Studies and Artistic Initiatives.</p>

<p>Her commitment to artistry and leadership is expressed on and off stage, as she appears as soloist, chamber musician, and pedagogue passionate about empowering young artists who will uphold our art form. She has appeared as a soloist with the Houston Symphony, and presented recitals for Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, Texas Music Festival, Kosciuszko Foundation and Coastal Concerts. She has premiered and recorded music by Caroline Shaw, Avner Dorman, Michael Hersch, Ezra Laderman, and commissioned works from Alistair Coleman, Edward Babcock, and Hua Yang.  Among the countless joyful moments of sharing the stage are treasured recitals with Roberto Díaz, Yefim Bronfman, Miriam Fried, Richard Goode, Ani and Ida Kavafian, Bomsori Kim, Patricia Kopatchinskaya, Tessa Lark, Anne-Marie McDermott, Tito Muñoz, Paul Neubauer, Tara Helen O’Conor, David Shifrin, Joseph Silverstein, Arnold Steinhardt, Philippe Tondre, Michael Tree, Peter Wiley, Danbi Um; the St. Paul and Mahler chamber orchestras; Third Coast Percussion; A Far Cry; and the Dover, Jasper, and Aizuri string quartets.</p>

Vail, Chelsea, Olympic, and Ojai music festivals; Verbier Academy; Cal Performances; Caramoor; IMS Prussia Cove; Music from Angel Fire; and Chamber Music Northwest, among others. An episode on her by Emmy® Award-winning producer Jim Cotter’s Articulate show aired on PBS in 2021.</p>

<p>Ms. Yang is an alumna of the Curtis Institute of Music, the Juilliard School, and the Yale School of Music, where she received the Parisot Award for Outstanding Pianist and the Alumni Association Prize. Her past teachers include Li Qing, Timothy Hester, Claude Frank, Robert McDonald, and Peter Frankl. Ardent to champion young voices on this pedagogical legacy, her own students have soloed with the Philadelphia Orchestra and entered Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Bard Conservatory, Vanderbilt University Blair School of Music, Eastman School of Music, Peabody Institute, and Indiana University. She has given masterclasses at UCLA, Mannes College of Music, University of Oklahoma, The Suzuki School, and for New York Youth Symphony. She won the 2018 Musical Fund Society prize and the Kosciuszko National Chopin Piano Competition.</p>

<p>When not serving the various keyboards related to her roles, her intentionally incognito presence may be revealed by a quivering Micron pen as she sketches from the back of concert halls. The work of a lifetime is where she hopes to question, explore, and linger every day.</p>
