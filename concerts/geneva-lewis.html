<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>

<p>In September 1777 Mozart set off with his mother on a prolonged and ill-fated journey that was to
take them to Munich, Mannheim and Paris, where, following a brief illness, Maria Anna Mozart died.</p>

<p>In Munich, Mozart came across the recent violin sonatas of the successful opera composer Joseph
Schuster. Mozart thought highly enough of them to send them on to the remaining members of the
family. As things turned out, Mozart didn’t begin to write his own set of six violin sonatas until
early in the following year, by which time he had already been in Mannheim for some two months. He
completed the series after reaching Paris in the spring of 1778.</p>

<p>Among the Mannheim sonatas, the Sonata in C major is unusual in beginning with an adagio whose broad
melody is given out by the violin before being handed over to the piano for an even more rhapsodic
continuation. This is, however, no ordinary slow movement, but rather a sonata form whose various
stages unfold in contrasting tempi. Mozart continues this pattern in the playful second movement, a
stately minuet with periodic interruptions in a faster tempo. Perhaps Mozart had in mind a game of
“musical partners”, the last couple dancing alone at the end.</p>
