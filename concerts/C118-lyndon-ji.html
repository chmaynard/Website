In recent seasons, he has been invited to perform in both traditional and contemporary settings at distinguished events including the Gijón Piano Festival, American Matthay Association, American Liszt Society, Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Bowdoin International Music Festival (Fellowship), Norfolk New Music Workshop, and the Mozarteum Summer Academy. From childhood, Lyndon studied piano with Chun-Chi An in his hometown, debuting with the Carmel Symphony Orchestra in 2012, but his primary interest was in Mathematics. He completed his B.S. in Mathematics at Yale University, graduating with several awards and honors before working as one of the inaugural Swensen Fellows in Strategic Analysis. During his undergraduate studies at Yale University, he continued piano under the tutelage of Elizabeth Parisot and Wei-Yi Yang. After deciding to pursue music, he began studies at the University of Michigan with Logan Skelton, but, unable to quash his academic inclinations, left to study as a Toshizo Watanabe Fellow at the Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies in Yokohama. Upon return, he completed his Master of Music from the University of Michigan and Artist Diploma at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music with Roberto Plano. He is currently a candidate for the Doctor of Musical Arts program at the Yale School of Music, once more under the guidance of Wei-Yi Yang. Outside of music, Lyndon enjoys brewing coffee in all forms, cooking, video games, and marveling at the joint antics of his wife and two cats." />
