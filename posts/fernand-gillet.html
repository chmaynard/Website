He is at home and at ease anywhere; but there is something about Gillet that leaves you wondering if he really likes being away. His parents were both French and both musical, his father a well-known composer and ‘cellist. Despite his French origin, he has an Anglo-Saxon air which unquestionably comes from having been brought up in an English school. In the [First] World War, he served for four and a half years as an aviator.</p><p>M. Gillet is reticent and the meaning of his words is very often oblique. When he was asked what instrument he thought the best, he replied: “A great artist.” His uncle was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Gillet">Georges Gillet</a>, the teacher of oboe at the Paris Conservatory. Although young Gillet had started off as a pianist, the opportunity of learning the oboe at the Conservatory presented itself—and his destiny was settled.</p><p>Source: <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra 1936</em> by Gerome Brush.
