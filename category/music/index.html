        <h5>2021-01-17 00:00:00 -0500</h5>
        <p><p>IN MORE THAN two thousand Boston Pops performances of “The Stars and Stripes Forever,” a moment always arrived when Lois Schaefer was the star of the show. Though she was a master of the memorable piccolo solo that ends the work, she didn’t take her eyes off the musical score.</p>

        <p><p>Unlike many arts organizations, <strong>Core Memory Music</strong> does not have a Facebook page. Why not? The answer is simple: our audience doesn’t want to hear from us on Facebook.</p>

        <h5>2018-08-01 00:00:00 -0400</h5>
