        <p><p>TECHNOLOGY tends to separate normal from natural. Our bodies weren’t designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or to get so little exercise. There may be a similar problem with the way we work: a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.</p>

        <p><p>Unlike many arts organizations, <strong>Core Memory Music</strong> does not have a Facebook page. Why not? The answer is simple: our audience doesn’t want to hear from us on Facebook.</p>

        <h5>2019-11-01 00:00:00 -0400</h5>
        <p><p>I’m not sure how I discovered the writings of Sherry Turkle, but for a long time I was hoping to find someone who thinks like her. Dr. Turkle is a clinical psychologist on the faculty at MIT. She has been doing research on the effects of computing technology on our mental health, and in particular on our capacity for empathy and solitude. To introduce you to her ideas, here’s my adaptation of an  <a href="https://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-3-questions-for-sherry-turkle-mit-psychologist-20181020-story.html">op-ed</a> published last year in the Hartford Courant.</p>

        <h5>2018-11-24 00:00:00 -0500</h5>
        <p><p>OLD TOM BOMBADIL. Possibly the least liked character in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. A childish figure so disliked by fans of the book that few object to his absence from all adaptations of the story. And yet, there is another way of looking at Bombadil, based only on what appears in the book itself, that paints a very different picture of this figure of fun.</p>
