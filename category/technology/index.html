        <p><p>Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple and of Pixar Animation Studios, delivered the commencement address at Stanford University on June 12, 2005. Mr. Jobs was introduced by Stanford President John Hennessy. The full transcript of both speeches is reproduced here.</p>

        <p><p>TECHNOLOGY tends to separate normal from natural. Our bodies weren’t designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or to get so little exercise. There may be a similar problem with the way we work: a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.</p>

        <p><p>Unlike many arts organizations, <strong>Core Memory Music</strong> does not have a Facebook page. Why not? The answer is simple: our audience doesn’t want to hear from us on Facebook.</p>

        <h3><a href="/posts/sherry-turkle.html">Device Addiction and Loneliness</a></h3>
        <h5>2019-11-01 00:00:00 -0400</h5>
        <p><p>I’m not sure how I discovered the writings of Sherry Turkle, but for a long time I was hoping to find someone who thinks like her. Dr. Turkle is a clinical psychologist on the faculty at MIT. She has been doing research on the effects of computing technology on our mental health, and in particular on our capacity for empathy and solitude. To introduce you to her ideas, here’s my adaptation of an  <a href="https://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-3-questions-for-sherry-turkle-mit-psychologist-20181020-story.html">op-ed</a> published last year in the Hartford Courant.</p>

        <h5>2017-10-01 00:00:00 -0400</h5>
        <p><p><strong>Linux today</strong> has millions of users, thousands of developers, and a growing market. It is used in embedded systems; it is used to control robotic devices; it has flown on the space shuttle. I’d like to say that I knew this would happen, that it’s all part of the plan for world domination. But honestly this has all taken me a bit by surprise. I was much more aware of the transition from one Linux user to one hundred Linux users than the transition from one hundred to one million users.</p>
